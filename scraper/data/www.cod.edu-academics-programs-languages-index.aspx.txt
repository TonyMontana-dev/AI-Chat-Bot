LANGUAGES PROGRAM

World language courses are applicable in a wide variety of career fields.
Language skills are becoming increasingly valuable as nations become more
interdependent. 

The Languages program offers transfer-level credit courses in Arabic
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/arabi/], Chinese
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/chine/], French
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/frenc/], German
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/germa/], Italian
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/itali/], Japanese
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/japan/], Korean
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/korea/], Russian
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/russi/] and Spanish
[https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/spani/]. Students can use the
transfer-level courses (2202, 2206, 2008, 2251 and 2252) to meet Humanities
General Education requirements for associate's degrees. All 1100 to 2252 courses
satisfy the Global/Multicultural Studies requirement. Contact Counseling,
Advising and Transfer Services for more information.

In entry level courses, students develop the ability to speak, understand, read
and write in a cultural context. Intermediate transfer-level courses include
reading and discussion of modern texts, conversation, composition, grammar
review and cultural activities. Advanced conversation and composition courses
are offered in French, German, Italian, Japanese and Spanish. In addition,
culture and civilization courses taught in English are offered about Arab
nations, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Latin America and Spain.

Students can enrich their language and culture studies through study abroad
[/academics/academic_opportunities/field/studyabroad/index.aspx] programs in
China, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain.
