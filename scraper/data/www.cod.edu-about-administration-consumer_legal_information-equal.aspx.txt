Consistent with federal and state law, the Board of Trustees will facilitate
through the Affirmative Action Officer equal employment opportunities to all
persons regardless of their race, color, religion or creed, sex, national
origin, ancestry, age, marital status, sexual orientation, arrest record,
military status or unfavorable discharge from military service, citizenship
status, use of lawful products while not at work, physical or mental handicap or
disability (if otherwise able to perform the essential functions of the job with
reasonable accommodation), or other factors which cannot lawfully be the basis
for an employment decision.

The term "employment opportunities" includes hiring, promotion, termination,
wages, benefits, and all other privileges, terms, and conditions of employment.

In accordance with federal law, the College will maintain a written Affirmative
Action Program to implement and maintain the policy of equal opportunity through
positive efforts. (Board Policy 15-5)

Non-discrimination applies to all areas of the College, including the following
departments: Admissions, Educational Services, Employment, Financial Aid,
Placement and Recruitment. The lack of English language skills shall not be a
barrier to admission and participation in educational programs. Admissions
criteria and descriptions of educational programs are available in the College's
printed and online semester Class Schedule [http://myaccess.cod.edu/] and
College Catalog [https://catalog.cod.edu/].

The following persons have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the
non-discrimination policies:
