ESSAI

A resource for both students and instructors, ESSAI is an annual publication
that features some of the best academic writing created by COD students across
the curriculum and at all levels of learning.

scholarship and sophistication of students. It also exemplifies the notion that
good writing stimulates analytical and creative thinking, records information,
demonstrates learning and communicates effort and integrity in a flawless,
eloquent and graceful manner.

Included are multi-disciplinary selections such as expository and reflective
essays, literary criticism, research projects, science and technology reports,
math projects, exam answers, journal entries, in-class writing, business letters
and resumes, newsletters, and focused responses to coursework.
