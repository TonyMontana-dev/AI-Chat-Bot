College of DuPage is committed to our students and the community, regardless of
immigration status. We understand that undocumented students, DACAmented
students and mixed-status families of our community face challenges when
navigating college. College of DuPage has designated an undocumented student
liaison in order to stay on top of emerging needs and be an advocate for
students and their families.


GETTING STARTED AT COLLEGE OF DUPAGE

If you are a new to College of DuPage and need help with submitting your
application or paying for college, COD has resources that can help.

To get started with your application, follow the steps to enrollment
[/admission/steps-to-enrollment/index.aspx]. Undocumented and DACAmented
students should submit the general application and not the international
application. When you begin filling out your general application to apply to
COD, follow these tips: 

 * Use your full legal name; do not shorten your name or use nicknames.
 * Use your personal email; do not use a school or family email account.
 * Only sections with a red asterisk are required to answer on the application.
 * Answer the question, “Are you a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident?”
   correctly, even though this question does not have a red asterisk.
 * Leave the “Visa Type” question blank. If you are an international student
   seeking F1-Visa, visit International Student Services
   [/student_life/resources/intl-student-services/index.aspx].  

The general application requires a social security number. To obtain an
alternate identification number, contact your assigned admission representative
[/admission/admissions_contact/index.aspx] or the Office of Admissions and
Outreach at (630) 942-2626. For more information, schedule a campus visit
[/admission/visit_cod/index.aspx]or attend an upcoming admissions event.
