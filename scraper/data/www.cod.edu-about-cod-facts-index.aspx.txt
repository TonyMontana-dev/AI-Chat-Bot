INSTITUTIONAL PHILOSOPHY

 * College of DuPage believes in the power of teaching and learning.

   opportunities to learn and affirm the innate value of the pursuit of
   knowledge and its application to life. Our primary commitment is to
   facilitate and support student success in learning.
 * College of DuPage is committed to excellence.

   continual assessment and self-evaluation.
 * College of DuPage values diversity.
   We seek to reflect and meet the educational needs of the residents of our
   large, multicultural district. To this end, we recognize the need for freedom
   of expression and that facts, arguments, and judgments should be presented,
   tested, debated, challenged, deliberated, and probed for their objective
   truth in the marketplace of ideas. Every College individual owes a duty to
   exercise his or her own individual judgment; and to permit others to exercise
   that same freedom of conscience. We recognize the importance of embracing
   individual differences and cultures and value the contributions made to the
   College by people of all ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We affirm our role
   as a catalyst for promoting dialogue and tolerance on issues supporting the
   common good.
 * College of DuPage promotes participation in planning and decision making.
   We support participatory governance and the involvement of the College
   community in the development of a shared vision. We believe that all
   students, staff, and residents can make meaningful contributions within a
   respectful environment that encourages meaningful discourse. We strive to
   build an organizational climate in which freedom of expression is defended
   and civility is affirmed.
 * College of DuPage will be a benefit to students and community.
   The needs of our students and community are central to all we do.
