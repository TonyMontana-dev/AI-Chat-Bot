 * Prerequisite Frequently Asked Questions [/records/prerequisite-faqs.aspx]

A prerequisite is a required course that must be satisfied before you register
for classes. The following is a list of frequently asked questions regarding
course prerequisites. If you have additional questions, contact the Office of
Student Records at (630) 942-3838.

My registration was denied as "Registration prevented due to unmet course
prerequisites." What do I do next?

If you receive a notice that says your registration was prevented due to unmet
course prerequisites, the Office of Student Records does not have documentation
on file that your prerequisite has been met. 

For more information on proving you have met the course prerequisites, visit
proof of prerequisite [/records/proof-of-prerequisite.aspx]. 

What if I am currently enrolled in the prerequisite course at COD?

As long as all course prerequisite requirements are met, you will be allowed to
register based on your current course enrollment.

At the end of the term and after grades are posted, your record will be
automatically checked to verify that you have met the minimum grade criteria. If
you have not met the criteria, you will be dropped from the course.

What if I previously completed the prerequisite course or am currently enrolled
in the prerequisite course at another institution?

If you have previously completed a prerequisite course or if you are currently
enrolled in a prerequisite course at another institution, submit your class
schedule or unofficial transcript to prereq@cod.edu [prereq@cod.edu?subject=].
You will also need to submit the Prerequisite Verification Request Form
[/records/forms/prerequisite-verification-request.aspx] indicating the course
you are trying to enroll.

Will my demonstrated competency credit (articulated credit, College-Level
Examination Program, credit by proficiency or advanced placement) be considered
as meeting a prerequisite course?

Your demonstrated competency credit will be considered. Learn more about tests
that COD will accept [/academics/testing/tests-accepted.aspx] for competency
credit.

Will my SAT or ACT score serve as a prerequisite?

Depending on your score, you may meet reading, writing,or math prerequisites.
Refer to Proof of Prerequisite [/records/proof-of-prerequisite.aspx]for more
information.

Note: SAT scores from tests taken prior to 2016 are not acceptable for writing
placement. 

Will my high school grade point average serve as a prerequisite?

Refer to Proof of Prerequisite [/records/proof-of-prerequisite.aspx]for more
information. You can also email hstranscript@cod.edu
[hstranscript@cod.edu?subject=] with your questions. 

How does the system treat students with special circumstances?

Students who present special circumstances (for example, extensive work
experience) at the point of registration will be referred to the appropriate
academic division office and subsequently referred to a faculty member where
necessary.

What is my next step if a course allows for consent of instructor and I do not
meet the requirements?

If you do not meet the academic requirements to enroll in a course and the
course allows for consent of instructor, you can request a permit to enroll. You
can find the “Request a Permit” link under the Registration section on your
myAccess account.

How does the system handle prerequisites that were taken under the quarter
system?

The system can handle both quarter and semester courses.
