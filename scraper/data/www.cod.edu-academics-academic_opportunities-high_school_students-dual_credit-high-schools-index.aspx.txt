DUAL CREDIT HIGH SCHOOLS

College of DuPage has partnered with high schools surrounding the District 502
community to offer dual credit courses to high school students.

To find courses offered at your high school, click on the high school you attend
and use the following table to determine which courses are offered at your high
school each semester, the number of credits you can earn for each course and the
instructor's name.

If you are interested in taking dual credit courses, contact your high school
teacher. Your high school teacher has access to the dual credit admission and
registration form.
