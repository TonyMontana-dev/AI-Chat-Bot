   permitted, however texting is allowed.
 * Respect Learning Commons materials and equipment.
 * Beverages must be in covered containers.
 * No food may be eaten in the Learning Commons.
 * The Learning Commons is an instructional area; therefore, children are not
   permitted except when accompanying adults conducting business at a service
   desk (i.e. appointments, requesting info about drop-in or workshop sessions,
   etc.)
 * COD students who would like their parents to assist them at service desks may
   do so, but parents must wait in the reception area or public space outside of
   the Learning Commons during tutoring or coaching sessions.

   assistance in the Learning Commons.

 * Game playing and personal (not course-related) chatting are not allowed.

   graphics that may be offensive to others. Display of sexually suggestive
