HIGH SCHOOL GROUP VISIT

College of DuPage is excited to welcome in-district high schools to visit campus
for a college admissions presentation and campus tour. To accommodate as many
high schools as possible, there is a possibility that your group will be paired
with another school if you are unable to fill your visit. The Office of
Admissions & Outreach will not be able to accommodate out-of-district high
schools for campus visits. If you are an out-of-district school and have
questions, email campusvisit@cod.edu.  [campusvisit@cod.edu]

Schools may visit once per semester. Visit dates will be determined based on the
availability of our admissions representatives and student ambassadors. If you
are a high school teacher, we ask that you connect with the counseling
department at your high school regarding visits to College of DuPage.


ON-CAMPUS VISIT GUIDELINES

 * Groups of no more than 60 people
 * 1 chaperone required for every 15 students (60 students total)
 * Each high school may visit once per semester (Spring and Fall terms)
 * Please give priority to Seniors that are interested in attending College of
   DuPage 


FINAL REMINDERS

 * On-campus visits will include a presentation from an admissions
   representative and a tour of the Student Service Center, Student Resource
   Center and the Berg Instructional Center. 
 * Drop off group in front of the Student Services Center (near the Chaparral
   Statue). If you have a bus, they can park in College Lot 6, view a map of our
   campus.  [/about/visitor-information/maps-directions/pdf/full_campus.pdf]
 * If you are running late, call the Office of Admissions & Outreach at (630)
   942-2626.
 * If your group is planning to eat in our cafeteria (Subway and daily specials
   are available), we will need a 2-week notice prior to your visit day so that
   we can alert the staff. Meal vouchers will not be provided; cash and card are
   accepted.
 * If you must cancel/reschedule your visit, we require at least 2 days’ notice.
   Please notify your assigned admissions representative via email. 
 * You are responsible for the supervision of your students. Group visits take
   place while classes are in session, so make sure your group is respectful and
   not disruptive. Please make sure all cell phones are on silent and not used
   during the presentation and campus tour.
