ADDRESSING YOUR MAIL

The accuracy of the address affects the speed and delivery of your mail.


ADDRESS PLACEMENT

Print the delivery and return addresses on the same side of your envelope or
card. The addresses should be written parallel to the longest side.

The Postal Service will deliver the mail to the address designated on the
delivery address line, which is always the line immediately above the city,
state and ZIP+4 line.


ADDRESSING LETTERS

Print or type clearly with a pen or permanent marker so the address is legible
from an arm's length away. Do not use comma or periods.


ADDRESSING MILITARY MAIL

Military addresses must show the grade, full name with middle name or initial,
and PSC number, unit number, or ship name. Replace the city name with "APO" or
"FPO," an d the state with "AA" "AE" or "AP," and use a special ZIP code.


RETURN ADDRESS

A return address helps return the mail to you if it is undeliverable.


ENVELOPES

The size of the envelope should accommodate the contents. Excessively large
envelopes will not keep the inserts firm. If the inserts slide about, they
create an imbalance of the envelope, risking ripping and loss of contents. A
snug fit keeps the enclosure firm in the envelope providing for effective mail
handling. Overstuffed envelopes can burst at the seams upon impact with other
mail, resulting in a total loss of the mailing.

Work orders with an authorized budget signature are required on all of the
following:

 * All bulk Mailings
 * Any expedited services
 * International pieces exceeding $10.00 per item
 * Any single mail piece or parcel exceeding $10.00

It is unacceptable to separate large mailings to avoid completing requisitions.
Separating mail in this manner increases processing time and creates additional
postal expense for the college.

All departments are asked to contact the mailroom prior to the preparation of
the mailing material, for information and consultation regarding mailing plans,
in order to insure that mailed items meet the minimum specifications for
mechanical handling and facilitate proper scheduling.

Outgoing mail should be separated from interdepartmental mail.

Stamped personal mail may be deposited in any mail bags throughout the day.
Outgoing mail is delivered to the Glen Ellyn Post Office at the end of the day.
The mailroom will not affix postage to personal mail; it will be returned to
sender for postage. Charges for personal mail and parcels mailed through the
College mailroom are payable at time of service by cash, credit card, or
personal check.

If special instructions are necessary for sending mail, attach a note securely.
Do not use post it notes or write on letters, parcels, etc.

Letters of like weight and size sent to the mailroom should be banded together.
If they are not sealed it is helpful if all envelope flaps are up to expedite
processing.

Mail (other than first class #10 letter size) not marked for classification will
be sent at the lowest rate possible. (See definitions of mail classes.)
