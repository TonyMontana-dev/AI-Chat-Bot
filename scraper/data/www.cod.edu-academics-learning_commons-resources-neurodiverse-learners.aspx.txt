NEURODIVERSITY RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES 

Neurodiversity refers to a range of brain differences that can affect
processing, learning, and behavior.  Neurodivergent is a term used when an
individual's brain functions differently in one or more ways than what is
considered typical.  Students with autism, ADHD, learning disabilities, and some
psychological disorders may identify as neurodivergent.  Neurodivergent learners
often respond differently to traditional teaching methods.

Both neurodivergent and neurotypical students have strengths and challenges that
they encounter in the learning process. The Learning Commons is equipped to meet
the academic support needs of all students including but not limited to
neurodivergent learners, students with mental health concerns and physical
disabilities."
