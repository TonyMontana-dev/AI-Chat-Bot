Questions and/or errors regarding grades must be reported to your instructor or
the Division office within 45 days of the end of the semester. 


GRADE POINTS PER CREDIT

Grading System Grade Description Grade Points per Credit A High degree of
excellence in achievement 4 B Better than average achievement 3 C
Average/acceptable achievement 2 D Minimum standard of achievement 1 S
Satisfactory 0 SP Satisfactory/Pass 0 F Failure 0 I Incomplete 0 W Withdrawal 0
X Audit 0 Blank See Below 0 R Repeated course (See #7.) 0

 

 1.  Contact your instructor if you believe the grade assigned for a particular
     course is not correct.
 2.  If the grade is blank and the course was completed by the last day of the
     term, contact the Office of Student Records at (630) 942-2440/2445. If the
     course did not end by the last day of the term, the blank is temporary and
     will be changed to a grade when the instructor submits the grades to the
     Office of Student Records.
 3.  Refer to the College of DuPage Catalog, Academic Information, Academic
     Policy, for restrictions and time limitations for completion of "I"
     (incomplete) grades. 
 4.  The "S" (satisfactory) grade earns credit but is not computed in the grade
     point average. The "S" grade may not be changed to a letter grade (A, B, C,
     D, F) nor may a letter grade be changed to "S." Contact the Graduation
     department at ext. 2261 for restrictions in the applicability of "S" grades
     toward degree requirements.
 5.  The “SP” (satisfactory/pass) grade was issued in the 2020 Spring semester
     due to the sudden change to remote instruction. It can be used to satisfy
     any prerequisite and graduation requirement, subject to published
     degree/certificate limitations.
 6.  The "X" (audit) grade does not earn credit and is not computed in the grade
     point average.
 7.  If the grade is "R," it indicates that you were assigned a grade for the
     same course that was either the same or a higher grade than the grade
     assigned in that term. "R" grades earn no credit are not calculated into
     the term or cumulative GPA. The "R" grade ceased being used to indicate
     repeated courses after the Spring 2009 semester.
 8.  Beginning with the Summer 2009 Semester, repeated courses are indicated
     with a "R" next to the assigned grade on your official transcript. This
     indicates that you repeated the course and received the same or a higher
     grade. The cumulative GPA no longer reflects the original grade received as
     of the term it was retaken. Repeated courses will be granted credit only
     once except as noted in the "Course Descriptions" section of the Catalog.
 9.  Courses that are identified as Repeatable for Credit will have the grade
     and credit recorded until the allowable maximum credits are earned.
     Subsequent grades in the same course will not earn credit and will not be
     included in the cumulative GPA as of the term it was retaken.
 10. Please note the following: Repeats of courses taken before the 1983 Fall
     Quarter may not be reflected. If you believe the Repeat has not been
     identified, contact the Office of Student Records at (630) 942-2440/2445.
 11. Beginning with the 1985 Fall Quarter, courses numbered below 100 earn
     credit but are not computed in the GPA. Prior to the 1985 Fall Quarter,
     these courses were computed in the GPA. Note that credit earned in any
     course numbered below 100 is not applicable to any degree or certificate at
     College of DuPage.
 12. Effective Fall 2005, College of DuPage changed from the quarter system to
     the semester system. Courses numbered below 1000 (Example: Math 0481) are
     not computed in the Grade Point Average. Courses numbered below 1000 are
     not applicable to any degree or certificate at College of DuPage.
