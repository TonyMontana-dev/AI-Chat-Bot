CENTER FOR STUDENT SUCCESS

Since its inception in 2019, the Center for Student Success continues to be
committed to ensuring students have the knowledge, resources, and information
they need to successfully pursue their educational goals at College of DuPage.


NAVIGATORS HELP YOU SUCCEED

We know that attending college can be an overwhelming experience. Because of
this, all students new to COD are assigned a Navigator their first semester.
Through proactive outreach and one on one appointments, your Navigator will
support you by:

 * Proactively assessing and identifying your strengths, challenges, and needs
 * Developing an individualized support plan that incorporates the use of the
   campus resources and follow up appointments with your Navigator
 * Assisting you in understanding college policies and procedures
 * Answering any questions you might have as you proceed through your chosen
   academic path
 * Providing ongoing monitoring and support to amplify your strengths as a
   student, clarify goals, and assist you in limiting barriers to your success


QUARTER AND MIDTERM GRADE OUTREACH

Navigators monitor your course progress throughout the semester. If you receive
a grade of D, F or U at quarter and/or midterm, your Navigator will reach out to
you to assess the challenges you might be experiencing and help you get back on
a successful path. 

At any time throughout the semester, if you feel you are struggling in your
course(s) it is always better to act proactively and contact your Navigator as
soon as possible.  Don’t wait. We are here to support you.
