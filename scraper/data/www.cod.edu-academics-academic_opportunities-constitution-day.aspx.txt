CONSTITUTION DAY 2023

Constitution Day is a College of DuPage faculty initiative to commemorate the
formation and signing of the U.S. Constitution. Louise Leigh shared her love of
the United States Constitution throughout the country when she rallied for
recognition of Constitution Day as a national holiday. Her efforts along with
Senator Robert Byrd culminated in amending the Omnibus Spending Bill in 2004 and
officially named this day – Citizenship and Constitution Day. In May 2005, the
United States Department of Education backed this law extending its application
to any school receiving federal funds of any kind.

Taken together, the laws provided that the head of every federal agency provide
each employee with Constitution educational materials and that each educational
institution which receives Federal funds should hold a program for students
every Constitution Day.


CONSTITUTION DAY 2023


AN EMPOWERING APPROACH TO DEMOCRACY

Thursday, Sept. 14

11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Robert J. Miller Homeland Security Education Center (HEC), Room 1022

Light lunch will be provided.

Gain a better understanding of how the U.S. Constitution shapes our lives during
this interactive exploration of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, which
says:   

Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishments inflicted. 
 
Representatives from the Restore Justice Foundation will share stories, explain
how a bill becomes a law and teach participants how to build support for issues
and work with legislative representatives. 
 
Students who attend the event can earn credit.
