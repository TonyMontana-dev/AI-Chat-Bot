Chicago – Bachelor of Arts in Healthcare Management


CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY CHICAGO – BACHELOR OF ARTS IN HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT

The Bachelor of Arts degree in Healthcare Management 3+1 program with Concordia
University Chicago is a great way to continue your education. Students are
required to complete an Associate in Applied Science degree in Dental Hygiene,
Diagnostic Medical Imaging Radiography, Emergency Medical Services, Management,
Physical Therapist Assistant or Respiratory Care at College of DuPage in order
to be eligible for the program.

Once accepted to College of DuPage, students must complete a series of
prerequisites in order to be considered for admission into the AAS Degree
program in Dental Hygiene [/academics/programs/dental/index.aspx], Diagnostic

Physical Therapist Assistant
[/academics/programs/physical-therapist/index.aspx] or Respiratory Care

admissions requirements for your program of choice before continuing. As part of
the admission process into the selective health science programs at COD,
attending an advising session for the AAS in Dental Hygiene or Respiratory Care
