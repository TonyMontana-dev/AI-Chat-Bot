If you are looking to get word out about an event or would like to reach out to
students or the community, we can help you craft your message and reach your
target audience. When you place a Marketing Request in Workfront, a content
writer/editor and designer will work with you to ensure that your project runs
smoothly and is completed on time. We are here to work with you and our services
are free.


COLLEGE OF DUPAGE MARKETING RULES OF ENGAGEMENT


PLAN AHEAD

 * When you give our department time, we can be at our creative best for your
   project. If you submit a request without the minimum timeline established,
   your project could be denied.


MEET TO START A PROJECT

 * If you need help getting started, contact Publications Coordinator Jim
   Vosicky at vosickyj@cod.edu [vosickyj@cod.edu?subject=] and he can arrange
   for an in-person or Zoom meeting to discuss your project needs. 


COMPLETE A MARKETING REQUEST THROUGH WORKFRONT

 * Make sure to include account number, quantity and all pertinent information
   in the description to ensure the request is clear to the editor and designer
   assigned to the project.


EACH PROJECT REQUIRES ITS OWN MARKETING REQUEST

 * Each project requires its own marketing request. If you need a poster, flyer,
   email message, text message and postcard for an upcoming event, then you will
   need to submit five marketing requests in Workfront.

    content in most cases when adding a marketing request.

MARKETING BRANDING TEMPLATES

Marketing and Communications offers brand templates for COD faculty and staff to
create their own COD-branded documents for official use. This does not replace
working directly with Marketing on projects though. Faculty and Staff may submit
a Workfront Project Request first to determine if a project should go through
this system. Learn More
