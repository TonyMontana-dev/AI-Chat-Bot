Your financial aid offer letter will provide you with the financial aid that you
qualified for based on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA),
whether it is grants, loans, work study or a combination of all three. It is
important that you read and understand your financial aid offer letter. 


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

The following Frequently Asked Questions can help you understand your financial
aid offer letter. 

How is my financial aid determined?

Your financial aid award is based on your demonstrated financial need, as
determined by subtracting your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from your Cost
of Attendance (COA) at College of DuPage.

Your EFC is calculated by the Federal Processor based on information you
submitted on your FAFSA. 

Your Cost of Attendance includes:

 * The Board approved tuition and fee charges for full-time enrollment for a
   nine month period (an academic year)
 * Allowance for room and board according to the living arrangements specified
   on your FAFSA
 * Allowance for books, transportation and personal expenses as dictated by
   federal regulations

How do I accept my financial aid?
If you have a Pell Grant, MAP Grant, Student-to-Student Grant or Supplemental
Education Opportunity Grant, you do not need to accept these awards in your
Financial Aid Self Service. These awards will automatically be accepted. 

If you have a Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized Loans you will need
to accept, reduce or decline those awards.To accept, reduce or decline your
Direct Loans, you will need to complete the following steps:
 1. Accept your Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans through your Financial Aid
    Self Service
 2. If you don’t want to accept the full amount of your Subsidized Loan, you can
    complete the Direct Loan Form to reduce your loan award
 3. If this is your first time borrowing, you must complete Entrance Loan
    Counseling [https://studentaid.gov] 
 4. You must complete a Master Promissory Note [https://studentaid.gov].   
    https://studentaid.gov

You do not have to accept any or all of your Direct Loans. If you wish to reject
your Direct Loans or accept a smaller amount of loans, you will need to complete
a Loan Change Form in the Office of Student Financial Assistance. 

If you have Federal Work Study: You can contact Human Resources
[/about/humanresources/] and begin applying for student aide positions. Being
awarded Federal Work Study does not guarantee a student aide job on campus, you
still need to complete the application and hiring process. Your Student Loans
may be reduced to allow for Federal Work Study eligibility.
Do I need to be a full-time student in order to receive financial aid?
No, you do not need to be a full-time student to receive financial aid. Students
must be enrolled in a minimum of six credit hours to receive some form of
financial aid. To receive your full grant awards you would need to be enrolled
full-time. If you enroll less than full-time, then your grant awards will be
prorated.

The actual disbursement is based on your enrollment status
[/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-documents-forms/pdf/amounts_enrollment.pdf] as
of the census date. The census date is referred to as the end of the add/drop
period for the class. Classes added or dropped after the census date will not be
used to determine your actual financial aid disbursement amount. This may cause
you to owe a balance at the College of DuPage.

 * Full-time: 12 credit hours or more 
 * Three Quarter time: 9 to 11 credit hours
 * Half-time: 6 to 8 hours 
 * Less than half-time: 1 to 5 credit hours

Students must also be registered and academically engaged in their classes the
entire length of the semester. Students who are reported as Non-Attend on
Enrollment Verification Rosters will have their financial aid awards adjusted
accordingly. Federal Regulations require students receiving financial aid –
whether it is grants or loans – to be registered and academically engaged in
their classes. No attendance means No Financial Aid.

If your financial aid is awarded after the census date, your financial aid award
could be determined by your enrollment hours at that time.

For more detailed information, visit us Eligibility Based on Enrollment Status
[/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-documents-forms/pdf/amounts_enrollment.pdf].
Can I register for classes?
When you register for classes, your tuition is due the day you register.
 1. If your balance is not fully covered by financial aid or military benefits,
    you are required to enroll in a payment plan or pay your account balance in
    full. See the College’s payment policy
    [/costs/tuition/payment-plans/payment-policy.aspx] for more information.
 2. If you are registering for a class after it has already started, you will
    need to talk to a Financial Aid Representative before you register for your
    class.
 3. If you drop a class, this may cause you to owe money to COD. Please talk to
    a Financial Aid Representative before you drop your class.
 4. Note: Financial aid can only cover up to 30 semester hours of below 1000
    level courses.

Can I use my financial aid to repeat classes?
Financial aid cannot pay for classes that have been repeated more than once,
when a grade of D or higher has already been earned.
 
Note: Financial aid is considered grants and loans.
 
How do I buy books with my financial aid?
If you have excess financial aid funds in excess of your tuition and fees, you
may be eligible to purchase your books at the Bookstore on campus during our
Bookstore Dates [/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-aid-dates.aspx].
 1. The amount of money available for book purchases will be dependent upon how
    much funds are remaining after covering tuition and/or fee costs. The
    Bookstore Dates can be found on the Financial Aid Dates
    [/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-aid-dates.aspx] page.
 2. You can view how much money you have available for books by logging into
    your myACCESS and clicking on Available Amount for Book Purchase
 3. You cannot purchase books until you have received your financial aid offer
    letter.

How do I pay my tuition with my financial aid?
The Office of Student Financial Assistance will apply your financial aid funds 
- whether grants or Direct Loans - to cover your tuition and/or book costs.
 
For specific disbursement information, visit our Financial Aid Dates
[/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-aid-dates.aspx] page.
When will I receive my refund check?
Any financial aid funds in excess of tuition charges and/or book charges, will
be refunded to you in the form of a refund check.
Students can receive their refund electronically by signing up for eRefunds
[https://myaccess.cod.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TYPE=M&PID=CORE-WBMAIN&TOKENIDX=1842271417]
through their myACCESS.

Typically, the refund will be available 10 to 14 business days after the funds
have been applied to your student account and create a credit. Funds will not be
released before the semester begins.
 
The Cashiers Office will contact you via your COD email address when your refund
is available.
 
For up-to-date information regarding disbursement dates, visit the Financial Aid
Dates [/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-aid-dates.aspx] page.
Is there a maximum amount of Pell Grant money I can receive?
The amount of Federal Pell Grant funds a student can receive over his or her
lifetime is limited by a new federal law to be the equivalent of six years of
Pell Grant funding. Since the maximum amount of Pell Grant funding a student can
receive each year is equal to 100%, the six-year equivalent is 600 percent. For
more information visit Calculating Pell Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used
[https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell/calculate-eligibility].
Is there someone I can sit down with and talk to about my award letter?

[/costs/financial_aid/contact.aspx] at at (630) 942-2251 to schedule an
