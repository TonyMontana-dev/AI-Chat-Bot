STUDENTS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE

Students in higher education are increasingly struggling to meet basic needs. To
provide assistance, College of DuPage has designated a Benefits Navigator to
assist students in determining eligibility for and connecting them to public
benefit programs and campus-wide and community resources.

If you are a student in need of assistance, or a faculty or staff member working
with a student in need contact the College of DuPage Benefits Navigator:

Sandy McKeen [mckeens@cod.edu?subject=]
Benefits Navigator
(630) 942- 2237
mckeens@cod.edu [mckeens@cod.edu]


RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS IN NEED

Assistance with basic needs can relieve financial stress and provide students
with the tools and resources they need for student success. Below is a list of
local internal and external resources for students.

In addition to the Benefits Navigator the College has a Homeless Navigator

students who are at risk of or are experiencing homelessness, and an

students and families who are undocumented or mixed documented status.
