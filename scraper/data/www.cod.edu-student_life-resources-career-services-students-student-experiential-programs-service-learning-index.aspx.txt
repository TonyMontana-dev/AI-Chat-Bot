Service Learning is an academic-based volunteer program that combines volunteer
service with academic instruction. Service Learning requires students to
volunteer in the community for 15-20 hours for the duration of the semester.
Throughout the program, students work with an instructor to connect course
concepts with their service experience. 


SERVICE LEARNING BENEFITS FOR STUDENTS

 * Service Learning strengthens analytical and critical thinking skills.
 * Students have the opportunity to gain real-world experience while learning
   their coursework.
 * Students can become involved in assisting with an issue that is affecting
   their community.
 * Service Learning teaches citizenship and social responsibility skills that
   can last a lifetime.
 * Service Learning is a resume builder, and an opportunity you can share on
   scholarship essays and transfer applications.
 * Service Learning can ignite an interest in pursuing service as a career.

If you are interested in learning about Service Learning contact
