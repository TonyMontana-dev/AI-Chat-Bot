   [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/math/test-scores.aspx]
 * Test Scores for Non-Math Courses
   [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/math/test-scores-non-math.aspx]

The math and geometry placement exams are used to measure your mathematical
skills to determine your proper course placement. Most math and geometry courses
at COD have a prerequisite. These prerequisites may be met using prior
coursework at COD or another college or a qualifying score on the ALEKS Math
Placement Test.

Before taking your placement test, new students must apply for admission
[/admission/index.aspx] and obtain a COD ID number, username and password. A
photo ID, COD ID number and COD username/password are required to begin the
test.

There is no fee for your first ALEKS account. A charge will be assessed for
account resets. 

Testing is available at the main campus Glen Ellyn Testing Center; at the
Learning Commons in the Addison, Naperville, Carol Stream or Westmont Center; or
in the Virtual Testing Center. 


MATH PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS

ALEKS PPL MATH PLACEMENT TEST

ALEKS Placement, Preparation, and Learning (PPL) is a placement tool. The score
from Test 1 creates an individualized study plan for review prior to future test
attempts. All questions on the ALEKS test are free response (no multiple
choice).   

ALEKS PPL is used at College of DuPage to assess your current math skills,
create a personalized learning path to help refresh and improve your math
knowledge and place you into an appropriate math course based on your best
proctored assessment.

Engineering Pathways [/academics/transfer/uiuc_gatp.aspx].


USING YOUR TRANSITIONAL MATH PLACEMENT

Students who take the two-semester transitional math course in a College of
DuPage Community College District 502 high school can use their second semester
grade of A, B or C to enroll directly into select classes
[/academics/programs/math/math-transitions/math-transitions-placement.aspx].


ALEKS GEOMETRY

Registration for the following math courses require a Geometry Placement test
score: 0482, 1321, 1322, 1428 and 1431.

You may not need to take a Geometry Placement test if you have one of the
following:

 * A prerequisite math course with a grade of C or higher. For math classes
   taken at another institution, transcripts must be submitted and evaluated by
   the Office of Student Records [/records/transcript-evaluation.aspx].
 * A previous College of DuPage ALEKS Geometry score that meets the minimum
   score requirements.
 * A qualifying test score or course prerequisite
   [https://cod.edu/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/math/test-scores.aspx].

Note: Your comprehensive knowledge check scores will be used for course
placement. The comprehensive knowledge check may be taken up to two times.

Step One: Get Started with ALEKS Geometry
 1. Login to inside.cod.edu [https://inside.cod.edu/] with your COD username and
    password. For assistance logging in, contact the Student Help Desk at (630)
    942-2999 or studenthelp@dupage.edu [studenthelp@dupage.edu]
 2. In the Math Placement Test section, click the "Geometry Placement" link to
    either take your first test (Initial Knowledge Check) or work in Learning
    your study plan. Note: Your Initial Knowledge Check score will be used to
    recommend an individualized study plan in ALEKS Geometry and cannot be used
    for course placement. 
 3. Complete your Initial Knowledge Check or review in your study plan until you
    feel ready to take a proctored test.
 4. Geometry Review Workshops [/academics/learning_commons/workshops/index.aspx
    ] are also available to  review basic geometric principles in preparation
    for the Geometry Placement test. 

Step Two: Ready to take a proctored ALEKS Geometry Test
 1. Review Math Placement Test Guidelines.
    [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/math/math-placement-guidelines.aspx]
 2. Take a proctored test at one of the six testing locations
    [/academics/testing/locations.aspx].


GEOMETRY PLACEMENT TESTING FAQS

What courses require geometry as a prerequisite?

The following courses have a geometry prerequisite. You can satisfy the geometry
prerequisite using any of the following. 

For course descriptions and course prerequisite information, visit the College
of DuPage Course Catalog [https://catalog.cod.edu/].

Geometry Prerequisites Course Prerequisites COD Course* ALEKS PPL Score COMPASS
Geometry Score ALEKS Geometry Score ACT Math Sub Score Math 0482, Math 1428,
Math 1431  Math 0470  46**  30 30 23 Math 1321, Math 1322  Math 0470   45 50 24

*Prerequisite for Math 0470: Math 0481 with a grade of C or better, or a score
of 30 on the ALEKS PPL

**These scores expire in 18 months from the date they were earned (12 months if
taken before Jan 1, 2022) 

When do geometry prerequisites expire?

 The expiration varies depending on how you satisfied the geometry
prerequisite: 

 1. The ALEKS Geometry score, the COMPASS Geometry score, and the ACT math sub
    score never expire as geometry prerequisites. 
 2. The "C" or better in Math 0470 never expires. 
 3. The score of 46 on the ALEKS PPL Placement Test expires 18 months from the
    date it was earned, 12 months if the score is from before Jan. 1, 2022. 

I took the ALEKS PPL Placement Test and got a 46 or higher. Do I meet the
geometry prerequisite?

You meet the geometry prerequisite for Math 0482, Math 1108, Math 1428, and Math
1431. Note that this score expires 18 months from the date it was earned, 12
months if the score is from before Jan. 1, 2022.

If you plan to enroll in Math 1321 or Math 1322, you will need to take the ALEKS
Geometry Test. The 46 or higher on the ALEKS PPL Placement Test does not meet
the requirement for these classes. 

What should I know about the ALEKS Geometry test?
 * You may take the ALEKS Geometry placement test even if you’ve already taken
   the COMPASS geometry test.
 * You cannot use your own calculator. If ALEKS determines that a calculator may
   be needed, the calculator icon will appear on the screen. You will have to do
   some calculations by hand.  Pencil and paper will be provided.
 * All answers are free form—no multiple choice.
 * Most students will need about 1 – 1 ½ hours to complete the test.
 * Starting the testing process creates an account which will expire in 18
   weeks. You must have completed your geometry testing by then.
 * You will have 1 un-proctored “Initial Knowledge Check” (that does not count
   for placement) and up to 2 proctored attempts (which do count for placement).
