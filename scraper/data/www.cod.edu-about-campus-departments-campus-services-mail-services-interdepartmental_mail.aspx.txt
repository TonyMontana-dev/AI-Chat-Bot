Keep interdepartmental mail separated from outgoing mail. Be as explicit as
possible when addressing interdepartmental mail. Use first and last name of
addressee in addition to division/department name. Do not use room numbers

Reusable interdepartmental envelopes are available by calling the mailroom at
ext. 2249. Make sure all previous addresses have been marked out to ensure
proper delivery. The addressee should always appear on the last line below the
previous address. Large (10 X 13) and small (#10 - letter size)
interdepartmental envelopes are provided by Campus Services for all
interdepartmental mail. The only exception is U.S. mail being redirected to
another area. In this case, advise directly on the front of the piece where mail
is being forwarded.

Sample Portion of Large Envelope

[/about/campus-departments/campus-services/images/large_envelope.jpg]

Full-time faculty mail is delivered to the division offices only, not to the
part time faculty office in BIC2A07.

Improperly addressed mail will be returned to sender for address corrections.

Do not use first class business envelopes to send interdepartmental mail. They
can be overlooked if not clearly separated from other outgoing first class
envelopes. If it is absolutely necessary to use them for an internal mailing,
separate and rubber band the entire bundle. Mark " for interdepartmental mail
only".
