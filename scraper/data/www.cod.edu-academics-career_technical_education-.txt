Career and Technical Education (CTE) is education that directly prepares you for
the world of work by providing core academic and technical job specific skills
for a wide range of high-skill, high-wage and high-demand careers. Master the
fundamentals of a new trade or profession or build on established skills.


CTE STUDENT SUPPORTS

Support programs are available for Career and Technical Education students who
meet special populations criteria. Support programs include textbook support
funds, laptop and wi-fi hotspot loans, and transportation support.




DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES

CTE educates students in 16 career clusters and over 79 career pathways. College
of DuPage offers over 250 degrees and certificates
[/academics/programs/career_technical_info_sheets.aspx] in a full range of
existing and emerging industries and professions.

 * The Associate in Applied Science degree represents the completion of study in
   a career and technical education program. Students earning this degree may
   seek employment following graduation or transfer
   [/academics/transfer/index.aspx] to a baccalaureate-granting college or
   university that has an articulation agreement with the College of DuPage.
 * Certificate courses of study are designed for students not pursuing an
   associate’s degree, but who are interested in taking technical or
   professional courses needed to enter a field of employment or update current
   skills.


DUAL CREDIT

Career and Technical Education focuses on developing partnerships between high
schools and postsecondary education, developing clear pathways for students to
follow toward degrees and certifications. Students can earn dual credit
[/academics/academic_opportunities/high_school_students/dual_credit/index.aspx]
while in high school. Dual credit students have the opportunity to enroll in
selected courses at their high school and receive both college and high school
credit.
