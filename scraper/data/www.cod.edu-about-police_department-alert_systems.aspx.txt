WHAT IS COD ALERTS?

COD Alerts is the college’s automated system for notifying you of school
closings and other important information. You are automatically enrolled in the
system when you register for a class and you remain in the system until three
terms pass in which you have not enrolled. COD Alerts can send text messages to
your cell phone, emails, and even play a recorded message on your phone.

To view and update your contact information for COD Alerts, log onto
the InsideCOD Portal [https://inside.cod.edu/] using your COD Username and
password and click the link for “Emergency Alerts/COD Alerts” on the left.

The Everbridge Mobile App is available in the iTunes or Google Play store. Sign
into the app using your COD account name and password.

The Everbridge Mobile App provides the following functionality:

 * SOS – notifies the College of DuPage Police Department if you need emergency
   help while on the College’s Glen Ellyn Campus.
 * Safe Corridor – If you find yourself in an uncomfortable or vulnerable
   situation on campus, this button will trigger an SOS if your safe code is not
   entered in a given period of time.
 * Call COD Police – This button connects you directly with the College of
   DuPage police.
 * Submit Tips – This feature allows you to silently and discreetly send a
   message to College of DuPage police.

Note that you will still receive COD Alerts even if you do not download the
Everbridge Mobile App.
