Textbook support is available to students enrolled in a Career and Technical
Education (CTE) Associate of Applied Science Degree or Certificate program.
Students must meet one of the qualifiers listed on the checklist and be enrolled
in a minimum of one course. Students enrolled in the spring semester are
eligible for $250. Students must be registered for classes through the
withdrawal period or funds must be repaid. Funds will be deposited in the
student's financial aid account and can only be used at the Follett College of
DuPage Bookstore. Funds cannot be used to reimburse.

Financial support is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis for the
semester, and any unused funds will be returned to College of DuPage. Students
will be notified of their award status and can view their award through their
myACCESS Financial Aid Self-Service account. CTE Textbook Support can only be
used at the bookstore during the standard financial aid window, no sooner than
three weeks prior to the start of term and no later than two months after the
start of term.

NOTE: The application for Spring 2024 will open on Jan. 3, 2024.
