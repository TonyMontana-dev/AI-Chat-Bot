Community Engagement takes various forms at College of DuPage and COD is not
tied to any one model of engagement. Focused on supporting the College’s mission
to be a center of excellence in teaching, learning and cultural experiences,
outreach efforts range from large on-campus community events, educational and
community based presentations to academic partnerships and volunteerism.

We invite you to explore the opportunities linked below and peruse the Community
Resources Guide [/gateways/pdf/community-resources-guide.pdf] for available
programs and services.
