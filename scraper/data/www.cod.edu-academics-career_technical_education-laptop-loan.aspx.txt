Career and Technical Education (CTE) Laptop and Wi-Fi Hotspot loans are
available for students enrolled in a CTE Associate of Applied Science Degree or
Certificate program. Laptops and Wi-Fi Hotspots can be borrowed for one semester
at a time and can be picked up at the College of DuPage Library.

Your use of a College of DuPage CTE Needs Based laptop or Wi-Fi hotspot is
governed by the College of DuPage policies outlined below. By completing this
form you agree to abide by these policies.

You are expected to make every reasonable effort to protect your laptop or Wi-Fi
hotspot from damage and to use it for appropriate academic purposes. If you
withdraw or drop all courses for the semester you are required to return the
devices (including power adaptor and computer bag) to the Library no later than
ONE WEEK after your withdraw/drop date. 

I understand and agree that I am responsible for paying for the cost of the
loaned technology ($842) in the event it is lost, damaged, or not returned. I
understand and agree that any resulting balance will be placed on my student
account, and in the event of delinquency, the College shall have the right to
(1) prevent me from registering in future classes, (2) drop me from my current
or future registered classes, (3) prevent me from obtaining official grades,
transcripts, and/or diploma from the Office of Student Records, and (4) employ a
collection agency to collect the debt, which may have an adverse effect on my
credit.

Additional software may be installed ONLY if required by syllabus or for
instructional use.

If you need technology support, contact the Student Helpdesk
[/student_life/resources/information_technology/hours.aspx] at
studenthelp@cod.edu [studenthelp@cod.edu] or (630) 942-2999.

This program is funded through the Strengthening Career and Technical Education
for the 21st Century Act.
