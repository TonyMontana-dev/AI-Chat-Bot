PROGRAM UPDATE

As of February 2023, the Operating Room Patient Care Technician (ORPCT) program
is currently transitioning to the Patient Care Technician (PCT) program. The
ORPCT program is no longer accepting new students at this time. Patient Care
Technician will be offered in Spring 2024. Additional details are coming soon.


PATIENT CARE TECHNICIAN (PCT) PROGRAM

The Patient Care Technician (PCT) Program provides hands-on assistance in
serving the basic needs of patients in a hospital setting. The PCT will perform
bathing, feeding catheter care, safety checks, and ensure patient room
cleanliness. The PCT will also obtain EKG readings, monitor vital signs, and
provide phlebotomy procedures. Ethical decision-making will provide
patient-centered care and compassionate support to families.

The program is designed to be completed within eight weeks and will be offered
every semester.

Completion of the PCT program allows the student to sit for the National
Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) accredited National Health Career
Association (NHA) Certified Patient Care Technician Exam (CPCT). The student
will sit for the exam at College of DuPage during the last week of the program.


PRE-ENROLLMENT CRITERIA

   three years of course start or, active CNA license.
 * Ethical Considerations in Health Care Industry (SURGT 1000) with a grade of
