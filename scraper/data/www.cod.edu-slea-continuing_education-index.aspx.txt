SLEA CONTINUING EDUCATION

SLEA is proud to provide law enforcement and public safety agencies with
educational opportunities of the highest standard. As part of the College of
DuPage Continuing Education, we recognize your need to continually build the
capabilities of your staff so they can keep pace with ongoing societal changes
and the challenges inherent in public service. We are uniquely suited to help
you do that with rigor in training approaches and state of the art facilities.

We offer programs ranging from our Basic Academy for new recruits to a broad
range of Continuing Education classes covering topics in investigations,
computer and Internet crimes, patrol and operations, emergency management and
response, people management, planning and administration and more. Leveraging
College of DuPage’s reputation as the fifth largest community college in the
nation, we are able to attract nationally renowned instructors.

We are proud of the solid reputation that we have built in the law enforcement
community. If you aren’t familiar with our offerings and programs, take a look
