CAREER SERVICES FOR COMMUNITY AND ALUMNI

Career Services supports community residents and alumni with the job search
process by equipping them with the appropriate tools and resources to secure
current or future employment. Career Services engages job seekers to help them
develop an employment plan and develop job search strategies and documents.
Career Services primarily assists community members and alumni through
individual appointments.


WEBINARS AND WORKSHOPS

Alumni and community members can sign up for live webinars
[/student_life/resources/career-services/students/workshop-schedule.aspx] for
help with resume building, social media, job search, interview preparation and
more.

Webinar attendees can ask questions via live chat to presenters during the
session. Alumni and community members are welcome to attend as many sessions as
they would like. Sessions are offered during the summer, fall, and spring terms
and topics rotate weekly.


REQUEST AN APPOINTMENT

Alumni and community members can schedule six appointments per academic year. To
schedule an appointment with Career Services, complete the Service Request Form
[https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=LtmHvtjshkW0fKUEZtBPTVq7jAIA0gxDnBeItC88qhhUN0lHRkgyVEhIRFZWRjIwUlI3SDdBVVVLTCQlQCN0PWcu&wdLOR=c8BA2BDDC-3007-C54E-8182-CB98F27482C5].
Appointments are generally scheduled for one-hour sessions. Career Services may
experience peak periods throughout the semester in which current students
utilize our services. As a result, our alums and community member offerings may
be limited.

Career Services does not offer walk-in services. Contact the Center at
csc@cod.edu [csc@cod.edu?subject=] before coming to campus to inquire about the
availability of programs or appointments. 


MISSED APPOINTMENT POLICY

 1. Community residents and alumni who do not attend the first 10-minutes of a
    30-minute appointment or 15-minutes of the start of a one hour appointment
    will forfeit their appointment time and will be marked as a no-show. 
 2. Appointments canceled within 12 hours of the scheduled appointment will be
    considered a no-show. 
 3. Career Services reserves the right to revoke appointment eligibility for
    community residents and alumni with three or more consecutive no-show
    appointments. Job seekers will have to wait until the following semester to
    schedule an appointment but may participate in webinars and hiring events
    and access online resources such as Chaps Get Hired and Career Coach. 

*A semester is defined as the start and end of 16-week classes in the fall and
spring and 10-week classes in the summer.
