All mailings require a postal work order signed by the authorized budget
signatory prior to processing. Mailings will not be processed until written
authorization is received by the mailroom.

If you have questions regarding the automated mailing process, call the mailroom
staff at Ext. 2249, who are extremely knowledgeable in postal requirements. They
will be able to coordinate all aspects of your mailing from start to finish.


SENDING DATABASES THROUGH EMAIL

 * Go to Global Address Book.
 * Type in or look for Mail Services-Automation. Please do not email databases
   to individuals within Campus Services or the mailroom; this email address
   alerts the necessary personnel.
 * Insert the database as an attachment file. The database should be an Excel
   file, or saved as a text tab delimited (txt) file.
 * Indicate any special handling required, requested mailing date, etc. in your
   email. Also indicate if your list requires purging of duplicate addresses.
 * Indicate which class your mailing will go:
 * First Class 500+ pieces
 * Third Class 200+ pieces
 * Indicate who is the contact person responsible for the mailing. This is
   important to provide someone who has knowledge of the mailing in the event of
   questions or problems with processing.
 * Press send.
 * Forward mailing materials with your signed work order to the for processing.


IMPORTING YOUR DATABASE

When received by Mail Services, the database is imported into DeskTop Mailer,
the software used to process all automated mailings. It is important to note
that from this step forward, all changes are made to the imported database, not
the original submitted by the mailer.


ADDRESS CORRECTION

After importing the database, it is processed for address correction. This step
assigns an error code to any address that is not deliverable by comparison to
the database used by the United States Postal Service (we receive updates every
3 months).

The non-deliverable addresses are pulled from the imported database to conform
to postal standards for automation. They are not deleted from the senders'
original database file. Non-deliverable addresses will not be mailed. An Excel
error file will be sent to the customer to indicate which addresses should be
changed for future mailings to insure a discounted rate, upon request.

This step prevents the payment of unnecessary postage for non-deliverable items
and provides the originator of the database the opportunity to make the
necessary corrections to their files for future use.


ERROR OR NON-DELIVERABLE FILES

The non-deliverable addresses that are pulled from the database are returned in
an attachment file via email to the sender upon request. This provides a means
for the sender to correct the addresses (sending those pieces out separately if
desired) and to update their database for future mailings.

Recipients of the mailing with incorrect addresses or error messages will not
receive the piece, unless the sender corrects the address and sends the pieces
separately.


CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR COMPLETED MAILINGS

Upon completion of all mailings an email is sent to the originator of the
mailing indicating the date the mailing was sent to the post office. Any extra
materials are also returned to the originator.

This message can also include two attachment files. One is the error file
showing the unmatched addresses (with codes) and a Postal Soft error code file
(which defines the error codes). All error files are sent via email.

Please be sure to identify the contact or person responsible for the mailing in
your communications. Often several individuals are involved in a mailing, so the
person receiving the email may not always be the person initiating the
paperwork. We want to be sure the proper people receive the notifications.


ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE IN THE MAILING PROCESS

Initial pre-planning and continued communication between Mail Services and the
mailer are imperative for the proper handling of mailings. Mailers should
communicate with us in advance of processing mail, particularly if they are
unsure of the process. This allows us to determine a time frame for processing.

We can provide information regarding postal regulations, designing pieces for
automation, the most cost effective ways to process mailings and guidelines used
in Mail Services for processing mailings. We can often identify cost savings and
improve processing (even during the designing stage).

Mail Services will often receive a mailing with no database, not enough pieces
to match the database, etc. This delays mailings until we can identify and
contact the originator to determine when all the required parts to the mailing
will be made available for processing. We can only be as efficient and effective
in our processing as the materials and data we are provided to work with.
Advance communication and planning can significantly reduce any setbacks in
processing.

Campus Services departments can be utilized to assist in reaching the "ready to
mail" stage by providing assistance with printing, folding, inserting, tabbing,
word processing, etc.


TIMING

As indicated previously, mailings not having all the necessary components
presented together delay the processing further. We ask mailers to notify Mail
Services prior to printing the piece, to allow us the opportunity to ask
questions to insure the mailings are being designed according to postal
regulations.

Thank you for helping us to reduce postal costs while improving the quality and
deliver ability of your mail. We look forward to automating your mail in the
future.
