Welcome to the COD Centers! Do you want to receive your degree and not go to
main campus? Do you want to gain knowledge and to improve job skills in the
comfort of your community? Or, do you want to pursue a special interest, gain
life enrichment, and attain personal goals?

Then take a look at the classes offered every term at each College of DuPage
Center.

The COD Centers are close to your home and offer morning, afternoon, and evening
classes on weekdays; morning and afternoon classes on Saturdays. Credit courses
include many that fulfill the general education requirements for each associate
degree and many that transfer to four-year college or universities. Adult
non-credit courses are available as well.

The COD Centers are a great place to start for traditional college students, as
well as adults who have been out of school for a long time and are apprehensive
about returning. Staff at each center can provide assistance, answer questions,
and schedule appointments with a counselor.
