Illinois APEX Accelerator
[/business-development-center/apex/images/ill-apex-logo.jpg]The Illinois APEX
Accelerator advisors guide businesses on how to expand into new markets and
navigate the maze of federal, state and local governmental contracting.
Expertise includes:

 * Bid Opportunity System: This customized service searches keyword terminology
   on over 2000 sites per day to identify opportunities at the local, state, and
   federal levels. 
 * Certification assistance (WBE, MBE, SDB, 8A, HUBZone, VOSB, SDVOSB, DBE): We
   help identify appropriate certification, review applications, and conduct a
   final analysis of the certification package. 
 * Proposal preparation assistance: Advisors can assess an opportunity received
   from a client to offer contracting expertise and recommendations for
   bid/proposal creation.

 * Pre- and post-contract review: Services include contract pre-award and
   post-award analysis plus contract compliance assistance after a bid is
   awarded. 
 * Market research: We help identify the Small Business Specialists at federal
   agencies to contact. Additionally, advisors will supply procurement histories
   on National Stock Numbers (NSN).
 * Registration assistance: Initial entrance into state or federal markets may
   require mandated registrations for which we offer detailed insights and
   recommendations.  Become a client and get FREE guidance.

Our training [https://ilsbdc.ecenterdirect.com/events] and advising is available
for new and existing businesses. Our grant funding requires that you register
