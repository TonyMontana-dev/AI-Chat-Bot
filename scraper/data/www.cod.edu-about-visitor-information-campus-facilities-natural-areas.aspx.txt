NATURAL RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION AREAS

COD maintains three natural areas on the Glen Ellyn campus: the Russell R. Kirt
Prairie, the Ecological Study Area, and the B.J. Hoddinott Wildlife Sanctuary.
The prairie and woodland areas are open to the public for nonconsumptive
recreational use. Removal of plants and seeds from these areas is prohibited.
View a map of the College of DuPage campus
[/about/visitor-information/maps-directions/pdf/full_campus.pdf] to locate a
prairie.


RUSSELL R. KIRT PRAIRIE

This 18-acre natural area
[/about/visitor-information/campus-facilities/pdf/kirt-prairie.pdf] consists of
about six acres of marsh, a one-acre retention pond, 11 acres of reconstructed
prairie and savanna planted between 1984 and 2000, and a quarter mile of
display/seed production beds planted in 1997 along the southern boundary of the
preserve. Over a half mile of trails, including a 1/6-mile wheelchair accessible
stretch, allows easy access for nonconsumptive recreational use.


ECOLOGICAL STUDY AREA

This 15-acre natural area
[/about/visitor-information/campus-facilities/pdf/ecological-study-area.pdf]
consists of about three acres of marsh, four acres of successional woodland, and
eight acres of reconstructed prairie planted between 1975 and 1997. Over a half
mile of trails allows easy access for nonconsumptive recreational use.


B.J. HODDINOTT WILDLIFE SANCTUARY

This nine-acre natural area is primarily a marsh and wetland that was dedicated
as a preserve in 1983. There are no trails through this area.
