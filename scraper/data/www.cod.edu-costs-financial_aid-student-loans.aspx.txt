For many students, borrowing loans to pay for college is the only option. The
Office of Student Financial Assistance wants to make sure you borrow wisely and
only what you need for college.

Any Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized loans will require you to accept
those awards. You do not have to accept any or all of your Direct Loans. If you
wish to reject your Direct Loans or accept a smaller amount you will need to
complete a Federal Direct Loan Form in our office. Remember – loans are money
you pay back.


FEDERAL DIRECT LOANS

Before you accept your Federal Direct Loans
[https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans], keep the following things
in mind:

 1. Don't expect to live off your Federal Direct Loans. Federal Direct Loans are
    to be used for education related expenses first, such as tuition and book
    costs. Any remaining loan funds can then be used towards living expenses.
 2. Do I need the full loan amount being awarded to me? Students are never
    required to accept their full Federal Direct Loan award. Students can reduce
    and/or decline their Federal Direct Loans. After all, this is money you will
    have to pay back.
 3. What education related expenses do I still need covered?
 4. Have I exhausted my options for grants, scholarships and/or work study?
 5. Make sure you know what you owe [https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans].

To accept your federal direct loans, you will need to complete the following
steps:

If you were awarded a Direct Subsidized Loan and you wish to accept your Direct
Subsidized Loan:

 * You will need to log into your myACCESS and click on Financial Aid Self
   Service to accept, reduce or decline your Direct Subsidized Loan. 
 * Complete Entrance Loan Counseling
   [https://studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=entrance]
 * Complete Master Promissory Note [https://studentaid.gov/mpn/]


DIRECT UNSUBSIDIZED LOAN

If you were awarded a Direct Unsubsidized loan and you wish to accept any
portion of your Direct Unsubsidized Loan:

 * You will need to log into your myACCESS and click on Financial Aid Self
   Service to accept, reduce or decline your Direct Unsubsidized Loan
 * Complete Entrance Loan Counseling
   [https://studentaid.gov/app/counselingInstructions.action?counselingType=entrance]
 * Complete Master Promissory Note [https://studentaid.gov/mpn/]

After you accept your Federal Direct loans, keep the following things in mind:

 1. Loans are an investment in your future! So when you don't attend your
    classes, keep in mind that you are borrowing money for classes you're not
    attending. Whether you finish the class or even your degree/certificate, you
    are still responsible for paying back that loan. Remember, loans are an
    investment in your future!
 2. When do I have to start repaying [https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans] the
    loans I  accepted? After you graduate, leave school or drop below half-time
    enrollment of 6 credit hours, you will have a six-month grace period before
    you are required to begin repayment [https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans].
 3. Have I accepted only what I need?


FINANCIAL AID TIPS

 1. You do not need to accept your full Direct Loan award. You can reject your
    award or accept a portion of your award. Remember: This is money you will
    pay back!
 2. You can prepay your loans at any time - without any penalty. You do not need
    to wait until you go into repayment to start paying back your loans!
