 * Academic Engagement - Participation in academic related activities, such as,
   but not limited to, taking exams/quizzes, completion of an academic
   assignment, paper or project, participating in an online discussion about
   academic matters, initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question
   about the academic subject studied in the course.
 * Academic Year - The nine-month period a student is enrolled in classes for
   the fall and spring semester.
 * Alternative Loan - A non-federal loan made by a lender such as a bank or
   credit union.
 * Award Letter - A letter that is provided to students telling them how much
   aid they are eligible to receive at that school. The types of aid and amounts
   will be based on your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
   information. The award letter will also provide you with the terms and
   conditions of your awards.

B

 * Bookstore Funds - Financial aid funds that students are able to apply towards
   required book and supply purchases in the campus Bookstore. The funds
   available for the purchase of books would be any remaining financial aid
   funds after covering tuition costs.

C

 * Cost of Attendance - The total amount it will cost you to go to school for an
   academic year. The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees; room and
   board (or a housing and food allowance); and allowances for books, supplies,
   transportation, loan fees, and dependent care.

D

 * Default - Failure to repay a loan according to the terms agreed to in the
   promissory note. For most federal student loans, you will default if you have
   not made a payment in more than 270 days. You may experience serious legal
   consequences if you default.
 * Deferment - A postponement of payment on a loan that is allowed under certain
   conditions and during which interest does not accrue on Direct Subsidized
   Loans, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans and Federal Perkins Loans. All other
   federal student loans that are deferred will continue to accrue interest. Any
   unpaid interest that accrued during the deferment period may be added to the
   principal balance (capitalized) of the loan(s).
 * Dependency Status - The determination of a Free Application for Federal
   Student Aid (FAFSA) applicant as dependent or independent.
 * Dependent Student - A student who does not meet any of the criteria for an
   independent student. An independent student is one of the following: at least
   24 years old, married, a graduate or professional student, a veteran, a
   member of the armed forces, an orphan, a ward of the court, someone with
   legal dependents other than a spouse, an emancipated minor or someone who is
   homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
 * Direct Subsidized Loan - A low interest, need based loan where the federal
   government will pay the interest while you are enrolled at least six credit
   hours.
 * Direct Unsubsidized Loan - A low interest, non-need based loan where the
   student is responsible for the interest on the life of the loan.
 * Disbursement - Payment of financial aid funds to cover a student's tuition
   and/or book costs.

E

 * Eligible Degree Program - A program of organized instruction or study of a
   certain length that leads to an academic, professional, or vocational degree
   or certificate, or other recognized education credential.
 * Entrance Loan Counseling - An online counseling program that all Direct Loan
   Borrowers are required to complete before loan funds can be released.  This
   is a U.S. Department of Education requirement.  The counseling session 
   explains your responsibilities and rights as a student borrower.
 * Expected Family Contribution - Your Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is an
   index number used to determine your eligibility for federal and state
   financial assistance. This number results from the financial information
   provided on your FAFSA.

F

 * Free Application for Federal Student Aid - The Free Application for Federal
   Student Aid (FAFSA) is the federal application that all students must
   complete to apply for federal, state and some institutional aid. The FAFSA is
   completed every academic school year.
 * Federal Work Study - Federal Work-Study provides student aide jobs for
   undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, allowing them to
   earn money to help pay educational expenses. The program encourages community
   service work and work related to the student's course of study.
 * Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 - The Family Educational
   Rights and Privacy Act of 1974
   [/about/administration/consumer_legal_information/ferpa.aspx], as amended,
   sets forth requirements designed to protect the privacy of student education
   records. FERPA governs (1) release of education records and (2) access to
   education records
 * Financial Need - The difference between the cost of attendance and your
   expected family contribution.
 * Financial Aid Self Service - The student portal that contains all of your
   financial aid information in one place, allowing you to view your financial
   aid status, review next steps, submit financial aid documents, view your
   awards and accept or cancel loan offers.
 * Federal Student Aid ID - The Federal Student Aid ID (FSA ID) is a username
   and password combination that serves as a student's or parent's identifier to
   allow access to personal information in various U.S. Department of Education
   systems and acts as a digital signature on some online forms.

G

 * Grants - Financial aid, often based on financial need, that does not need to
   be repaid (unless, for example, you do not successfully complete your classes
   and funds are returned to the U.S. Department of Education.

I

 * Institutional Student Information Record (ISR) -  This is the electronic
   version of your Student Aid Report that the school receives after you have
   filed your FAFSA.

M

 * Monetary Award Program (MAP) Grant - The MAP Grant is awarded to Illinois
   residents who attend approved Illinois colleges and demonstrate financial
   need. MAP Grants are limited based on the number of applicants and funding
   levels appropriated by the Illinois General Assembly.
 * Master Promissory Note - A binding legal document that you must sign when you
   get a federal student loan. The MPN can be used to make one or more loans for
   one or more academic years (up to 10 years). It lists the terms and
   conditions under which you agree to repay the loan and explains your rights
   and responsibilities as a borrower. It's important to read and save your MPN
   because you'll need to refer to it later when you begin repaying your loan or
   at other times when you need information about provisions of the loan, such
   as deferments or forbearances.

N

 * Non-Attend - When a student registers for a class but does not participate,
   whether through quizzes, tests, assignments or physical attendance. Reports
   of Non-Attendance can affect your financial aid.
 * Natinal Student Loan Database System (NSLDS) - Students can view their
   financial aid history online through the National Student Loan Database
   System [https://nsldsfap.ed.gov/].  Students can also access their loan
   information, as far as total amount borrowed and servicer information.

O

 * Origination Fee - The fee deducted by the Direct Loan Program proportionately
   from each loan disbursement you receive. This means the money you receive
   will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You're responsible for
   repaying the entire amount you borrowed and not just the amount you received.

P

 * Pell Grant - A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid.
   Federal Pell Grants usually are awarded only to undergraduate students who
   demonstrate financial need and who have not earned a bachelor's or a
   professional degree.
 * PLUS Loans - Federal PLUS loans are loans that parents of dependent,
   undergraduate students can use to help pay education expenses. Unlike the
   Federal Direct Loans, the Federal PLUS loans are not guaranteed. There is a
   credit check for the parent and the loan is in the parent's name, not the
   student's name.

R

 * Refund Check - Any excess financial aid funds that are remaining after
   covering required tuition and book costs.  Refund checks are available to
   students in the form of a check that must be picked up from the Cashiers
   Office.  A refund check is typically issued about 10 to 14 business days
   after the date of financial aid disbursement.
 * Refund Period - A specific period in which students can drop classes and
   receive either a 100% or 50% refund on the class. The refund period can be
   found in your myACCESS by clicking on your class schedule.  You can also
   contact the Registration Office.
 * Return of Title IV - This is the federal government refund policy.  Students
   who stop attending all classes prior to the 60% date of the term may be
   required to return their federal aid - including grants and loans. This also
   applies to students who receive a failing grade or withdrawal in class for
   failure to attend.  The date used for this determination is the last date of
   attendance at an academically related activity.

S

 * Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) - The US Department of Education
   requires that all financial aid students make satisfactory academic progress
   in order to continue receiving federal student aid. In other words, you have
   to make good enough grades, and complete enough classes (credits, hours,
   etc.), to keep moving toward successfully completing your degree or
   certificate in a time period that's acceptable to your school.
 * SAP Appeal - The process by which a student can submit a typed, signed appeal
   requesting their financial aid eligibility be reinstated.  The basis for the
   appeal would be due to extenuating circumstances that prevented a student
   from maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress.  The final decision is made
   by the appeal committee.
 * Scholarships - Scholarships, unlike loans, don't need to be repaid.
   Scholarships are offered by schools, employers, individuals, private
   companies, nonprofits, communities, religious groups, and professional and
   social organizations. Eligibility for scholarships can be based on merit,
   need, community service, academic program and population specific.
 * Selective Service - A system under which men are called up for military
   service.  This is also referred to as the draft.
 * Servicer - A company that collects payments, responds to customer service
   inquiries, and performs other administrative tasks associated with
   maintaining a federal student loan on behalf of a lender.
 * Special Conditions Review - A process by which students can address changes
   in their financial situation since completing the FAFSA.
 * Student Aid Report (SAR) - A summary of the information you submitted on your
   Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You receive this report
   (often called the SAR) via email a few days after your FAFSA has been
   processed or by mail within 7-10 days if you did not provide an email
   address. If there are no corrections or additional information you must
   provide, the SAR will contain your EFC, which is the number that's used to
   determine your eligibility for federal and state aid.
 * Suspension - Student has failed to meet Satisfactory Academic Progress. When
   a student is placed on discontinuance they are no longer eligible to receive
   federal or state aid, including loans. Students do have the option to appeal
   their discontinuance status.

T

 * Tax Return Transcript - A Tax Return Transcript is requested through the IRS.
   The Tax Return Transcript is different than a Federal Tax Return. A Tax
   Return Transcript is simply a line-by-line print out of your Federal Tax
   Return.

V

 * Verification - Verification
   [/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/fafsa-verification.aspx] is the process
   your school uses to confirm that the data reported on your FAFSA is accurate.
   Your school has the authority to contact you for documentation that supports
   income and other information that you reported.
