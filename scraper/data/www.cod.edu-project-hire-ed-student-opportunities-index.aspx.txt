 * Earn a wage, receive healthcare benefits, paid time off and other employment
   benefits
 * Receive wage increases as skills increase or set milestones are reached.
 * Begin a career and earn college credits
 * Graduate with no college debt since employers pay for the full cost of the
   student's program courses, labs and fees

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Find answers to your frequently asked questions regarding the apprentice
program.

Who can apply to become an apprentice?

The apprenticeship program is geared toward:

 * Current students
 * Career changers
 * Veterans
 * Unemployed or under-employed individuals
 * Recent high school or GED graduates
 * Current high school students (students may be eligible to begin foundational
   skills courses while in high school.)

When can I apply to be an apprentice?
You can apply at anytime, after attending a Project Hire-Ed Information Session
[/project-hire-ed/information-session.aspx]. After viewing open positions and
identifying a position you'd like to pursue, you can submit an application.
How does the application process work?

In order to get started, you first need to attend an information session. Once
you've attended an information session, you will need to:

 * Review open positions
 * Submit an application and schedule an intake interview to determine career
   readiness

Eligible candidates will have their resume shared with employers. Once you are
accepted by the organization and employed, you will be able to earn income while
attending COD.

Having an apprenticeship has been the greatest thing that I’ve done for my
career and my life, so I would definitely say to others to go for it.
