Dear President Caputo:  
 
This letter is provided to extend your current Recognition through December 31, 2022.  Note that 
due  to  COVID-19  conditions,  many  elements  of  the  Recognition  process  are  currently  being  
conducted remotely.  This could change in the near future, dependent upon conditions.  
 
Once the Recognition process is completed, your Final Recognition Report will go to a subsequent 
ICCB Board Meeting.  Once approved, your college will be issued a five-year certificate. 
 
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Dr. Marcus Brown, Deputy Director of 
Academic Affairs and Student Success at    Marcus.brown@illinois.gov
 (217-524-5503) or Allison
