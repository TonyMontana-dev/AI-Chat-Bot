COD STORIES

Joe Aranki [/about/stories/faculty/images/joe_aranki.jpg]

"I know it’s overused sometimes, but they say to choose a job you love and you
will never have to work a day in your life. It must be true, because I don’t
feel like I’ve had to go to work yet.” - Joe Aranki

Joe's COD Story [/about/stories/faculty/aranki.aspx]


COD STORIES

Tom Robertson [/about/stories/faculty/images/tom_robertson.jpg]

"I hope my students develop the same curiosity I have to discover how something
works and why it works that way. I hope my students also appreciate the value of
continuous learning and how information updates allow them to remain proficient
and profitable in our profession." - Tom Robertson

Tom's COD Story [/about/stories/faculty/robertson.aspx]


COD STORIES

Matt Shanahan [/about/stories/faculty/images/matt_shanahan.jpg]

"Seeing a student come in knowing very little about cars and then graduating a
completely different person is what inspires me to improve what I do every day."
- Matt Shanahan
