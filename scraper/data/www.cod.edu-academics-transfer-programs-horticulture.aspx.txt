Opportunities


HORTICULTURE TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES

College of DuPage has partnered with several transfer institutions to provide
opportunities for students to complete a bachelor's degree in the horticulture
field. Students should make an appointment with a faculty member, counselor or a
program advisor to discuss these transfer opportunities.

For more information about Transfer Pathways, visit the College of DuPage
Catalog [https://catalog.cod.edu/programs-study/]. The Pathway represents a
typical course schedule for a student planning to complete the AA or AS degree
within two years, then transfer and major in a specific discipline. See your
Faculty or Academic Advisor to obtain specific requirements as course
requirements vary by transfer institution.

Articulation Agreements

College of DuPage has partnered with a number of colleges and universities to
create innovative transfer agreements for students to transfer seamlessly to
earn a bachelor's degree. Many articulated agreements have a predetermined
course plan and requirements. Students should work closely with the faculty or
the Counseling and Advising office regularly to ensure proper courses are taken.

Transfer Guides

Articulation Agreements and Guaranteed Admissions Programs are not the only ways
that students can transfer. College of DuPage courses are designed to transfer
to many different institutions. Transfer guides are available to aid students in
this process.

Transfer guides suggest specific College of DuPage course subjects that meet
prerequisites for specific majors. These guides also provide contact
information, basic information about the major, admission & degree requirements,
general education requirements and transfer policies. Explore transfer guides
[/academics/transfer/colleges/index.aspx] by transfer institution.
