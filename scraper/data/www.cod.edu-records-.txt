The Office of Student Records maintains and updates all academic records for
students including evaluating transcripts from other institutions, issuing
official transcripts for COD and Lyons Township Junior College and reviewing and
approving applications for degrees and certificates.

Student Records can also verify student enrollment for employment, loan
deferments and insurance purposes, provide proof of prerequisite or run a degree
audit.


RUN A DEGREE AUDIT

Students can run a degree audit [/records/degree-audit.aspx] online through
their myACCESS [https://myaccess.cod.edu] account, also available in the student
portal [https://inside.cod.edu]. An online degree audit shows your progress
toward completion of a degree or certificate at College of DuPage and the course
options available to satisfy your remaining requirements.


SUBMIT YOUR TRANSCRIPTS

Transcripts are considered official [/records/order-transcripts.aspx] only if
they are mailed in a sealed envelope and identified as official by the sending
institution. Your transcripts can be mailed to: 

College of DuPage
Office of Student Records
425 Fawell Blvd.
Glen Ellyn, IL 60137

Once your high school transcripts, college transcripts or international
transcript evaluations are sent to College of DuPage for review they become the
property of COD and will not be returned. If you have questions email
recordsoffice@cod.edu [recordsoffice@cod.edu] for assistance.

Institutions may send transcripts electronically through any of the major
exchange networks or by email:

 * High school transcripts: HStranscript@cod.edu
   [HStranscript@cod.edu?subject=High%20School%20Transcripts]
 * College transcripts: evaluation@cod.edu
   [transcript@cod.edu?subject=College%20Transcripts]

Transcripts sent by email from the student, even if from a college email
account, are not considered official documents.


VIEW FINAL COURSE GRADES

Final course grades can be accessed online through your myACCESS
[https://myaccess.cod.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TYPE=M&PID=CORE-WBMAIN&TOKENIDX=7361507609]
account. Questions or grading errors must be reported to your instructor or the
division office within 45 days of the end of the semester. 

Final course grades can be accessed online through your secure myACCESS
[https://myaccess.cod.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TYPE=M&PID=CORE-WBMAIN&TOKENIDX=7361507609]
account.


OTHER STUDENT RECORD SERVICES


COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

A course description is a written explanation of a course that includes topics
covered, credit hours and lecture/lab hours. This is taken directly from the
College of DuPage Catalog [https://catalog.cod.edu/]. Course descriptions are
most often used when transferring your COD credits to another college or
university. The school may need extra information regarding the courses you
completed when evaluating your transcript.

To obtain a course description, visit the College of DuPage Catalog
[https://catalog.cod.edu/]. For classes taken prior to the current Catalog,
submit the Course Description Request Form
[/records/forms/course-description-requests.aspx]. There is no fee for this
service.


COURSE SYLLABUS

A course syllabus communicates the instructor’s course design (i.e. goals,
organization, policies, expectations, requirements) to the students enrolled in
the course. To obtain a course syllabus, contact the appropriate divisional
office:
