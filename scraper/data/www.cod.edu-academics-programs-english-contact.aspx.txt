COD STORIES

Jason Snart [/about/stories/faculty/images/jason_snart.jpg]

"It is not necessarily the ‘B’ student becoming the ‘A’ student. The real
breakthrough is when you see a student’s realization that they have gone above
and beyond what they thought they were capable of doing.” - Jason Snart

Jason's COD Story [/about/stories/faculty/snart.aspx]


COD STORIES

Dannica Hubbard [/about/stories/faculty/images/danica_hubbard.jpg]

"Each day is different, each student is different. Students’ stories make up the
tapestry of my career at COD." - Danica Hubbard

Danica's COD Story [/about/stories/faculty/hubbard.aspx]


COD STORIES

Tony Bowers [/about/stories/faculty/images/tony_bowers.jpg]

“I am blessed to play a small part in helping students meet their own personal
potentials. As their instructor, I take that seriously. I want them to know that
they can do anything they set their minds to, and that they are worthy of
success.” - Tony Bowers

Tony's COD Story [/about/stories/faculty/bowers.aspx]


COD STORIES

Trina Sotirakopulos [/about/stories/faculty/images/trina_sotirakopulos.jpg]

"My students know more than they know they do. My job is to get them to
articulate their knowledge on the page, sounding credible while doing so." -
Trina Sotirakopulos

Trina's COD Story [/about/stories/faculty/sotirakopulos.aspx]


COD STORIES

Steven Accardi [/about/stories/faculty/images/steven_accardi.jpg]

"Whether it be a writing assignment or job interview or responding to an act of
misogyny or racism, I hope students would be able to read those rhetorical
situations, locate the available means of persuasion and respond to them in such
a way that their arguments have an effect." - Steven Accardi
