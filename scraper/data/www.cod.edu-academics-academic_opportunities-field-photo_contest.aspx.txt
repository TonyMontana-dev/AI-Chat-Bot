In Field Studies/Study Abroad/Global Ed, we are fond of saying, “Make the world
your classroom!” Each year we do just that, sending hundreds of students around
the world on amazing academic adventures. Here are some of our favorite
images taken on Field Studies/Study Abroad programs in recent years. Trust that
we are busy planning future courses/trips to extraordinary locations that we
shall visit with renewed vigor and perhaps a deeper appreciation of our ability
to travel the world. 


PHOTO CONTEST WINNER

Photo by Megan Kairies

"I recently studied abroad in Costa Rica. I noticed that the culture is more
about togetherness than in the States. They are the hardest working people, but
always make time for family. My host "Mamá Tica" is one of the hardest working
people and even though she had art classes, church duties, kids to take care of,
and her father that relies on her to take care of him - even with that, every
night she reserved at least an hour to talk to me and my roommate to make sure
we felt like family. It's just who Costa Ricans are. They are very loving and
welcoming people who make sure everyone feels like family. I love this photo
because my Mamá Tica loves butterflies and even made one for me in her art class
(it's hanging in my room). A butterfly to me represents a person who can bring a
smile to everyone’s face even if it's just for a short moment in time." Megan
Kairies, Study Abroad, Costa Rica
