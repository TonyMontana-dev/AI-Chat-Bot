Study the Spanish language and acquire a firsthand knowledge of the people and
culture of Spain. Spain is a splendid mix of 21st century culture and old-world
tradition. Madrid is located in the center of the Iberian Peninsula and offers a
wide array of cultural opportunities. According to Ernest Hemingway, Madrid is
"the most Spanish of all cities." It is impressive in its architecture and
vitality as well as its open green spaces.
