Complete the form to submit your application for a degree or certificate.


APPLICATION INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Complete a separate application for each degree and/or certificate. Do not
    complete this form if you received an email that said an application was
    submitted. If you are not sure if an application is already on file, send an
    email to graduation@cod.edu [graduation@cod.edu]. 
 2. You must have completed or be enrolled in your remaining classes for the
    term in which you are applying. Run your degree audit prior to submitting
    your application to verify your program status. (Exception: Summer
    applications are accepted prior to summer registration to allow attendance
    at commencement. Applications for summer will be accepted if there is a
    reasonable expectation that you will be able to complete all courses in
    summer.)
 3. If you are planning on attending commencement, your application must be
    received by March 15 to have your name in the commencement booklet. If you
    will not be attending commencement, submit your application after you have
    registered for summer.
 4. If you change your address after you submit this form, you need to email
    your new address to graduation@cod.edu
    [graduation@cod.edu?subject=Application%20for%20Degree%20or%20Certificate].
    Failure to update your address by sending an email will result in a
    significant delay in receiving your diploma.
 5. Your diploma will be printed with the name listed in the college’s system,
    but if you have a specific request for name formatting (ex: middle initial
    vs. middle name spelled out), email graduation@cod.edu [graduation@cod.edu]
    once you have submitted your application.  If you have a legal name change
    after submitting this form, you must provide proof to the Office of Student
    Records to have your academic record corrected and new name reflected on
    your diploma.
 6. Please be aware that all official college communications will go through
    your @dupage.edu account.

You can verify we have received your application by going to myACCESS Academic
Profile, My Profile and look under Academic Programs. The Graduation Application
Rec’d field should be yes. (Once your credential has been received, this
indicator will be removed.) Your application will be reviewed and may be
returned/refused if information is incomplete or if it does not appear that you
will be done by the term you have indicated.

Diplomas are mailed out six to eight weeks after the end of the term of
completion. Late applications result in later processing.

Any questions? Contact the Graduation Department at graduation@cod.edu
[graduation@cod.edu?subject=Graduation%20inquiry] or (630) 942-2340.
