So you want to be an entrepreneur! That’s great. Starting an enterprise, whether
it’s a small-business, tech startup or a new initiative within a large company
creates questions along the way.  Or as soon as one question is answered, other
new questions will surface at the same time and that can get confusing or
complex.

The “Top 10” questions below identifies and answers the most important
questions, answered by the experts for those interested in starting a business
in Illinois or in exploring the viability of a new idea:

 

Do I have experience in the area of my business?

Statistics report that the number one reason why businesses fail is lack of
experience. Put the odds in your favor by launching a business in an area where
you have the skill set, industry experience, passion and a good network of
technical expertise to help you succeed.

How much capital will I need to start a business?

Answering this depends on the type of business you open and your chosen
industry. Another useful estimate based on a study by the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation put the average cost of starting a new business at just over $30,000.

Many small businesses, particularly freelance, online and home-based businesses
startup costs are lower than this, often needing only a few thousand dollars to
get started.

Startup costs can typically be divided into six categories:

 1. Cost of sales
 2. Professional Fees
 3. Technology Costs
 4. Administrative Costs
 5. Sales & Marketing
 6. Wages & Benefits

It is important to identify all startup costs (expenses) and capital equipment
(assets) you will need to launch.

Do I have what it takes to be a small business owner or entrepreneur?

Most people generally have an innate ability to start a successful business. It
all starts with understanding your personality and tolerance for risk to know
what traits you possess versus what expertise you might need to bring in from
the outside to help (i.e. a business partner, outside technical expertise, a
strategists, a communicator).    

How should I structure my business?

 The majority of businesses start as sole proprietorships. The reason is in its
simplicity with business income reported the same as personal income for tax
purposes. The major disadvantage, however, is that you as the owner, are also
the business. That means you assume all liabilities for the actions of the
business and put your personal assets at risk.

Other types of business structures are general and limited partnerships, C
corporations, S-Corporations (S-Corp) and Limited Liability Companies (LLC).
Each has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of business you
are starting and you might consider obtaining legal guidance in this important
decision. Sources for comparisons on legal and tax considerations for different
business structures can be found at www.entrepreneur.com/article/38822
[http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/38822] or through the SBA. 

What customer problem do I solve?
As simplistic as it may sound, an entrepreneur identifies customer pain points
and creates solutions to resolve the problem. Whether you are opening a
restaurant, launching a beauty salon, creating a web-based business or
developing market transforming technology, the foundation of a successful
business starts with understanding your customer problems or pain points.    
What solution does my business provide?
 Once you understand customer problems, you are in a better position to provide
the right product or service at a cost that will return a profit to you
(hopefully). Ideally, your business should provide a solution that is better
than what your competition is offering (better, faster, cheaper). That is the
foundation of your business model.
What is my business model and how will I make money?

The answer to this question starts with understanding if the price of your
products and services covers all your expenses so that you make a profit. In
business, cash flow is king. Knowing how fast that will occur (in weeks, months,
years) is critical and whether a profit is realized and repeated.

For example, a restaurant's business model is to make money by cooking and
serving food to hungry customers. A website's business model may not be so clear
because there are many ways in which these types of companies can generate
revenue. Some websites make money by providing something “free” and then sell
advertising to other companies, while others might sell a product or service
directly to online customers.

Do I really need a business plan?
Statistics show that those who develop and implement a business plan tend to
survive and those who don’t, fail.

Whether you are a “reluctant” entrepreneur exploring a business while keeping a
day job, or a full-time entrepreneur preparing to open, your business plan is a
necessary guide to making your vision a reality.   A business plan demonstrates
your level of commitment to family, friends, employees and financial
contributors.

A business plan doesn’t need to be an intricate 20-40 page document. For
successful early stage ventures, a “lean” business plan can articulate in 8-10
pages, your company mission and description, where you want to go, how you will
get there and what outcomes to be expected.

More detailed plans are required for SBA loans or presentations to outside
investors. The Business Plan Handbook, Volume 7 is housed at the COD Library.
This resource is an excellent compilation of diverse business plans from
manufacturing and tech companies, to healthcare- software companies, web-design
businesses, and includes many traditional businesses such as restaurants, night
clubs, beauty salons, insurance, auto mechanics and hundreds more.

What key metrics are important for my business?

Use customer feedback over intuition. Early on, you can obtain critical key
metrics in your launch that can give you confidence to move ahead with your
investment in time and money.

Early feedback such as customer reaction to your concept (described to potential
customers asking “how likely are you to buy?”), or features, to knowing the
number of competitors in your market so you can differentiate yourself to
capturing customer satisfaction rates, return rates, repeat visits, number of
hits on your website, or even understanding how much it costs to obtain a
customer. These types of metrics should be the key drivers to your business
growth or necessary tweaks that may be needed in your first year.
