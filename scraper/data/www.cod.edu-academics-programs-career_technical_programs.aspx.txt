Certificate courses of study are designed for students not pursuing an
associate's degree but who are interested in taking technical or professional
courses needed to enter a field of employment or to update current skills. Most
courses taken in a certificate program may be applied to a degree in the same
field of study. Students may engage in areas of study which emphasize:

 * The arts and sciences, and offer the beginning of a baccalaureate-granting
   institution's curriculum
 * Occupational-vocational degree and certificate programs designed to fulfill
   the employment requirements of the community
 * Continuing education [/academics/continuing-education/index.aspx] and
   community service programs for individuals wishing to take one or more credit
   or non-credit courses on a part-time basis
 * Developmental programs that meet the needs of students deficient in
   fundamental skills

Each candidate for a certificate shall:

 * Satisfactorily complete all course requirements for the specific certificate.
 * Possess a minimum of 2.0 (C) average in the combined grade point average of
   all College of DuPage courses numbered 1000 and above on all courses.
