PARENT AND FAMILY GUIDE

The cost of college is a concern for nearly every student and family. The Office
of Student Financial Assistance [/costs/financial_aid/] provides a range of
services that help bridge the gap between the financial resources of students
and their families and the cost of education at College of DuPage.

As you look at ways to finance your student’s college education, we are here to
help you navigate the financial assistance process with your student.  


APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

How do we apply for financial assistance? Is there someone we can meet with to
talk about financial assistance?
Students who are interested in grants, loans or federal work study must complete
the Free Application for Federal Student Aid [https://studentaid.gov] (FAFSA).

Students interested in applying for scholarships can apply for scholarships
online. [/costs/scholarships/index.aspx] Some scholarships may require a FAFSA
to be filed. Each scholarship will have its own specific eligibility
requirements.

Financial aid representatives available. If you would like to set up an
appointment to meet with a financial aid representative, contact the Office of
Student Financial Assistance [/costs/financial_aid/index.aspx] at (630)
942-2251.
I don't claim my student on our taxes. Do I still need to provide our tax
information on the FAFSA?
Yes, whether you claim your student on your Federal Tax Return will not impact
your student’s status – as far as being considered independent or dependent.
When a student completes their FAFSA, they will be considered independent only
if they can answer “yes” to one of the following questions:
 * Is the student age 24
 * Is the student married, at time of application
 * Does the student have children or legal dependents that he/she financially
   supports more than 50%
 * Is the student currently serving on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, for
   other than training purposes
 * Is a veteran of the U.S Armed Forces
 * At any time since age 13, was the student in foster care or a dependent/ward
   of the court
 * At any time since age 13, was the student an orphan
 * As determined by a court in your state of legal residence was the student an
   emancipated minor
 * As determined by a court in your state of legal residence was the student
   placed in legal guardianship
 * As determined by a high school homeless liaison was the student determined to
   be an unaccompanied homeless or at risk of being homeless
 * As determined by a homeless shelter or transitional housing authority was the
   student determined to be an unaccompanied homeless or at risk of being
   homeless
 * As determined by a runaway or homeless basic youth center or transitional
   living program was the student determined to be an unaccompanied homeless or
   at risk of being homeless

If a student is considered to be dependent, then the student must submit
information in regards to their biological or adoptive parent. If a biological
or adoptive parent is remarried –at time of application- then step-parent
information would be submitted.
I am divorced and/or separated, how do we fill out the FAFSA?
Everything is at time of application:
 * If your current marital status is divorced at time of application – then only
   one parent’s information would be reported on the FAFSA, if you are not
   remarried. It would be the parent that the student lived with more during the
   12 months prior to filing the FAFSA.
 * If your current marital status is Married, but you are separated and living
   in separate residences at time of application – then only one parent’s
   information would be reported on the FAFSA. It would be the parent that the
   student lived with more during the 12 months prior to filing the FAFSA.

Our income has changed. How do we tell FAFSA that?

When the FAFSA is submitted, you are reporting your tax information as reported
on your Federal Tax Return. If there has been a change in income since filing
your taxes then you would want to contact the Office of Student Financial
Assistance [/costs/financial_aid/] about filing a Special Conditions Form.

The Special Conditions Form will allow you to provide documentation to our
office in regards to an income change; such as a job loss, loss of benefits,
etc. The office would adjust the student’s FAFSA accordingly. The FAFSA would be
re-processed based on the new income amounts. 

Note: Submitting a Special Conditions Form does not automatically guarantee a
change in the student’s award.

We already completed our FAFSA, but we have not received anything in the mail
from COD.
Students are contacted primarily via their COD email address; we do not mail
information out to the student or to the parents. Be sure your student is
checking their COD email address and myACCESS regularly.
 * If your student has not set up his/her myACCESS [https://myaccess.cod.edu],
   have your student log into myACCESS and set up their account
 * If you student was not aware he/she had a COD email address, have your
   student setup their email account
   [/student_life/resources/information_technology/email/email_guide.aspx]. 

How can I check the status of my student’s financial aid?
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) limits who can access a
student’s account of financial information. Parents and others are not allowed
to access a student’s account or financial assistance information unless the
student has authorized the school to do so. 
 
The student may visit the Office of Student Records [/records/index.aspx] and
complete a FERPA Waiver
[/about/administration/consumer_legal_information/ferpa.aspx] which authorizes
College of DuPage to release account and financial assistance information to a
designated third party. Without a FERPA Waiver
[/about/administration/consumer_legal_information/ferpa.aspx] on file, COD
cannot discuss your student’s financial assistance information.

The student should be able to log into their myACCESS to see if there are
documents missing or if an award letter is available to them. The entire process
can take up to 30 days from submitting the FAFSA to receiving an award letter.
It is important that the student checks their COD email address and myACCESS
account regularly.
 
Can financial assistance information be emailed to me, the parent?
All information is emailed directly to the student via their COD email address.
 
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) limits who can access a
student’s account of financial information. Parents and others are not allowed
to access a student’s account or financial assistance information unless the
student has authorized the school to do so.
 
The student may visit the Office of Student Records and complete a FERPA Waiver
[/about/administration/consumer_legal_information/ferpa.aspx] which authorizes
us to release account and financial aid information to a designated third party.
Without a FERPA Waiver on file we cannot discuss your student’s financial
assistance information.


STUDENT LOANS

How do we apply for a student loan?
The first step to apply for a Federal Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan is
to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online at
https://studentaid.gov [https://studentaid.gov/] The Federal Direct Subsidized
and Unsubsidized Loans are educational loans that do not require a co-signer
and/or a credit check.  The loans will be in the student’s name only. 

Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan is a low interest loan based on
financial need as determined by your Expected Family Contribution and Cost of
Attendance. The federal government pays the interest while you are in school or
during your 6-month grace period. Current interest rate information can be found
online at studentaid.gov [https://studentaid.gov/] . The student must enroll and
be actively participating in a minimum six (6) credit hours or more to be
eligible for a Subsidized Stafford Loan. 

Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan is a low interest loan and not based
on financial need. You are responsible for interest payments while in school.
Current interest information can be found online at studentaid.gov
[https://studentaid.gov/]. The student must enroll and be actively participating
in six (6) credit hours or more to be eligible for an Unsubsidized Stafford
Loan.
How much of a loan can we request?
The amount of loan money a student may request will be based on their grade
level:
 * Freshman (students who have earned less than 30 credit hours, including
   transfer hours) - $5,500
 * Sophomore (students who have earned more than 30 credit hours, including
   transfer hours) - $6,500

NOTE: The student’s total award – including grants, loans, scholarships and
Federal Work study – cannot exceed their Cost of Attendance.
We want to apply for a Parent PLUS Loan. Where do we go?

The first step to apply for a Federal Direct PLUS Loan is to complete the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid
[https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa] (FAFSA) online at studentaid.gov.
You will then need to complete a PLUS Promissory Note. The Federal Direct PLUS
Loan does require a credit check. If you are approved for a PLUS loan you will
need complete a PLUS Request Form to our office. Parents may request up to the
student's Cost of Attendance minus any other financial aid received by the
student.

Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) is borrowed by the
parent on behalf of their dependent student and is not based on financial need.
Current interest rate information can be found online at studentaid.gov The
student must enroll and be actively participating in six (6) credit hours or
more to be eligible for a PLUS Loan.

What if I am denied for a PLUS Loan?

If you are denied a PLUS loan then the student may request up to an additional
$4,000 in Unsubsidized loans to help cover their educational expenses. The
student will need to complete and return a Federal Direct Loan Form to our
office to request the additional Unsubsidized Loans. This is not an automatic
process.

Can we use the loan funds for housing costs?

Student loans will be first be applied to your student’s tuition and/or book
costs.

Any loan funds in excess of tuition and/or book costs will be made available to
the student to be used for additional educational expenses, including housing
[/student_life/resources/housing/index.aspx] and transportation costs. 

NOTE: Refunds are not available until mid-semester. Mid-semester for fall
semester is around the middle to end of October. Mid-semester for spring
semester is the middle to end of March.  that would be around middle to end of
October. For the Spring Semester it would be around the middle to end of March. 


MANAGING COSTS

I have a 529 Plan, how do I use that to pay for my student's tuition?

If you have a College Illinois plan, your student will need to contact Mary Brew
in the Registration Office at time of registration or before registering for
classes.  The student will need to complete a form with Mary Brew. You can
contact Mary Brew at (630) 942-3289.

If you have any other 529 plans, your student will need to contact the Cashier’s
Office and ask for a “do-not-drop” hold to be put on their account. Your student
will then need to contact the 529 Provider and arrange for payments to be sent
to College of DuPage. You can contact the Cashier’s Office at (630) 942-2206.

Is there financial assistance available to pay for housing costs?

Financial assistance – whether it is grants or loans - will first be applied to
your student’s tuition and/or book costs.

Any loan funds in excess of tuition and/or book costs will be made available to
the student to be used for additional educational expenses, including housing
and transportation costs. 

NOTE: Refunds are not available until mid-semester. Mid-semester for fall
semester is around the middle to end of October. Mid-semester for spring
semester is the middle to end of March.  that would be around middle to end of
October. For the Spring Semester it would be around the middle to end of March. 

Can we buy books with financial aid?
If on your student’s award letter, they have enough financial assistance funds
in excess of their tuition and fees, your student  may be eligible to purchase
your books at the Bookstore on campus.

The earliest students can purchase books directly against any financial
assistance is about 1 week before the semester begins. The amount of money
available for book purchases will be dependent upon how much funds are remaining
after covering tuition and/or fee costs. The bookstore dates
[/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-aid-dates.aspx] will be available
online.

We live out of district, how will this affect financial aid?
If you live out of district this will not affect the amount of financial
assistance awarded to your student, however, living out of district will affect
cost of tuition. For information regarding our tuition rates
[/costs/tuition/index.aspx].
Are payment plans available?
Yes, payment plans [/costs/tuition/payment-plans/index.aspx] are available
through the Cashiers Office. 
 
How can I see my student’s bill?
Your student can access their payment information online through their myACCESS
account by clicking on the View/Update Existing Payment Plan link.
 
The student can also add an Authorized User to their account. This would allow
you to access their account information, setup payment plans and/or make
payments on the student’s behalf.
 
The Authorized User would then also be able to view online statements or
schedule payments. If the student elects to add you as an Authorized User, the
student will then click on the Authorized Users tab from the top menu. The
student will enter the email address of the person they would like to add as an
Authorized User.
