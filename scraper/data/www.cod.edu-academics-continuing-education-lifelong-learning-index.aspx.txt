Lifelong Learning has to offer this fall.


EVOLUTION OF THE PYRAMIDS

Join us as we study the Ancient Egyptian monuments of the Old Kingdom—the age of
pyramids. Our goal is to analyze how, when and why ancient Egyptians created
these mammoth tombs that resulted in the Great Pyramid, the largest and most
complex stone structure ever created. We will discuss religious motivation,
construction methodology, resources, human resources, successes and failures.
Our thesis is that the Great Pyramid is the culmination of five centuries of
Egyptian religious and burial practices. Instructor: Tim Dailey

THE ‘ENTERPRISE OF ENGLAND’: THE FATE OF THE SPANISH ARMADA

Elizabeth had a complex relationship with Spain. Its king, Philip II, had once
proposed marriage to her. His ‘great enterprise’ against England in 1588
threatened to destroy both her and her nation. A remarkable set of
circumstances, miscalculations and mismanagement played into the defeat and
destruction of the Spanish Armada. Elizabethan specialist Marcus Sanghera
reveals the history, the research and the latest findings.
