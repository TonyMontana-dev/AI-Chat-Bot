 * PSI Program Series
   [/academics/continuing-education/career-professional-training/public-service-institute/series.aspx]

The goal of the Public Service Institute (PSI) Leadership Excellence and
Development program is to provide professional development and comprehensive
training for the ongoing success of local government agencies and their
employees. PSI has developed Programming focused on key topics and best
practices in public service leadership. Enroll in these series and leave

in your field to bring back leadership lessons that you can use day one! 




FALL 2023 PROGRAMMING

Check out our Fall PSI programs! We have continued PSI Project Management
training and we now have six separate series within Engaging Employees, Leading
Teams, and Organizational Leadership.

Engaging Employees I

Thursdays, Sept. 14 to Oct. 5
8 to 11:30 a.m.
BSPSI-0700-100, $495


EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT

Thursday, Sept. 14

The beginning of any journey involves understanding where you are starting. The
same is true of understanding your own strengths and weaknesses for the purpose
of personal development in the workplace. Participants will be taken on a
journey of self-discovery to identify core values and, most importantly,
prevailing attitudes toward the work they do.


BEHAVIORAL STYLES IN THE WORKPLACE

Thursday, Sept. 21

We each bring a unique behavior style into the workplace that directly relates
to our performance. Participants review a model of four primary behavioral
styles to better understand their personal style as well as the styles of
co-workers. Attendees will create a personal action based on their strengths and
internal goals, as well as use SMART criteria to drive positive results. (This
session includes a DISC assessment.)


MANAGING PRIORITIES AND TIME

Thursday, Sept. 28

Every day, employees are faced with reports, meetings, multiple requests and
things that need to be done on short notice. Participants will examine multiple
approaches to time management and learn techniques to effectively manage
priorities. They will find answers to the question:How am I supposed to get all
of this done? To decide what work is most important, employees need to
understand the specific desired outcomes and know how to break those into daily
responsibilities.


EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION SKILLS

Thursday, Oct. 5

Effective communicators can clearly share ideas and goals, which leads to
enhanced performance in the workplace. Participants will learn strategies to
enhance verbal, non-verbal, written and listening skills. This session seeks to
improve both personal and organizational communication utilizing DISC assessment
styles.

Leading Teams I

Wednesdays, Sept. 27 to Oct. 18
8 to 11:30 a.m.
BSPSI-0800-100, $495


TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP

Wednesday, Sept. 27

Transformational leadership creates important, positive change. It is grounded
in the belief that inspiring others to focus on the greater good produces a
level of excellence that exceeds results achieved by other forms of leadership.
This program will walk you through the four components to transformational
leadership -- calling, charisma, challenge, and caring -- allowing you to
develop the skills and techniques required to make a real difference at your
workplace and to inspire others to work toward a shared vision of positive
change.


PLANNING AND EXECUTING EFFECTIVE MEETINGS

Wednesday, Oct. 4

Peter Drucker once said, “We can meet or we can work. We can't do both at the
same time.” While the number of meetings we attend increases, it certainly feels
like his words ring true as meetings have become synonymous with unproductive
time. In this interactive session, you will learn the secret to well-managed
meetings and ensuring they provide value to participants. You will take away
tools and processes around best practices for before, during and after the
meeting so all future meetings move the organization forward to their desired
results!


ETHICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Wednesday, Oct. 11

Ethics is about people; about how we treat others and ourselves. Government and
public service ethics adds an additional layer of accountability and
responsibility to act in the best interest of the public. This workshop provides
a content-rich framework for seeing, reflecting and growing ethical competence.
The presentation and discussion will focus on three key subjects: the definition
of ethics, the process of "breaking bad" and ethical competence.


INFLUENCING OTHERS

Wednesday, Oct. 18

Andy Kaufman, Institute for Leadership Excellence and Development Inc. will
facilitate this session. Whether or not you are in charge, this workshop will
provide you with key skills for getting things done. Understanding the
difference between influence and manipulation, including how the distinction
makes all the difference. Discussions regarding influencing strategies from some
of today's leading thought leaders, including references that you can follow-up
with for further learning will be explored. Improve your ability to manage “up”,
get agreement from peers, and motivate those around you, enabling you to work
more effectively on projects as well as cross-functional teams.

Organizational Leadership I

Tuesdays, Oct. 3 to Oct. 24
8 to 11:30 a.m.
BSPSI-0900-100, $495


EQUITY AND INCLUSION

Tuesday, Oct. 3
Studies have shown that an inclusive recruiting environment considers how
different experiences, opinions, and values can work together to achieve a
common goal. By creating a diverse workplace, your teams are pushed to think
outside their comfort zone and embrace new thoughts and ideas. Learn best
practices to create more inclusive recruitment and hiring practices.


COACHING AND DEVELOPING OTHERS

Tuesday, Oct. 10


Coaching and developing employees are key to being an effective supervisor,
manager and leader.  This interactive seminar will provide an overview of the
importance of coaching and developing employees and will provide participants
with a toolkit for effective coaching. The seminar will include role playing
difficult conversations, when and how to coach employees and sources for
professional development.


LISTENING: ADVOCACY AND INQUIRY

Tuesday, Oct. 3


Balancing advocacy and inquiry is an important listening tool that increases our
potential to learn in challenging situations, especially when a successful
resolution is enhanced or even dependent on the full contribution of all team
members. It enables us to gain more insight into others' reasoning, build on
multiple perspectives and develop more creative solutions. Through conversation
with others, by balancing advocacy and inquiry, we can skillfully share our
views with others and come to understand their assumptions and reasoning. An
imbalance between advocacy and inquiry can lead to dysfunctional conversations
and ineffective group processes. 


DATA DRIVEN DECISIONS

Tuesday, Oct. 24

The use and understanding of data is becoming a more important part of our
service delivery to achieve objectives. Learn how to use data to make innovative
decisions. Collect data, read and interpret data, present data in a way that has
merit, document successes and failures using data. 

PSI Project Management Training (one day training on campus)

Tuesday, Nov. 21
8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
BSPSI-0850-001, $225

Join us for this one-day, interactive session to increase your ability to lead
and deliver projects. Learn key principles that will help you deliver your
projects, including leading factors for project success and failure. Learn how
to develop plans to help you and your team stay on track as well as how to
respond when (not if) changes occur. Gain a better understanding of what
agile project management is (and isn't) and why it's relevant to more than just
systems projects. Walk away with practical techniques to identify and manage
risks so you can spend less time reacting to problems and more time avoiding
them in the first place.
