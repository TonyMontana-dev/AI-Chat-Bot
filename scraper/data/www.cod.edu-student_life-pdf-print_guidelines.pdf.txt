Distribution of Printed Materials Procedure 
College of DuPage 
Purpose  
The  College  of  DuPage  (the  “College”)  property  is  primarily  dedicated  to  academic,  student  life  and  
administrative functions but it also represents  the marketplace of ideas. To promote the free exchange of 
ideas, the College permits students, employees, and community members to distribute printed materials and 
to solicit signatures on campus subject to the reasonable restrictions of time, place, and manner contained 
in this procedure. The College does not assume any obligation or responsibility for the content of materials 
distributed.  
Nothing in this procedure permits the College to regulate the content of expressive activity protected by the First 
Amendment.    The  College  maintains  a  position  of  neutrality  as  to  the  content  of  expression  and  any  written  
material  distributed  on  campus  under  this  procedure.  The  College  shall  not  impose  restrictions  on  students,  
student organizations, or college employees due to the content or viewpoint of their expression or the possible 
reaction to that expression. 
Indoor Locations  
People wishing to distribute printed materials indoors will have a choice to  reserve  a  table  at  either  of  the 
following two locations based on availability:  
• An assigned table provided at the northwest corner of the intersection of the 1st floor hallways of the 
Student Resource Center and Student Services Center.   
• An assigned table on the north wall of the 1st floor lobby of the Health and Sciences Building (HSC).  
Reservation  requests  will  be  processed  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis,  but  in  the  event  that  multiple  
requests conflict, the following order of precedence shall govern: 
1. Official College sponsored events and activities; 
2. Recognized student organizations, events and activities; 
3. Student events and activities; 
4. All other College community events and activities; and 
5. Non-College affiliated speakers. 
Posted Disclaimer 
A  sign  indicating  the person/group’s  non-affiliation  with  the  College  will  be  provided  by  the  Office  of  
Student Life, SSC 1217, and will be displayed behind the table during the distribution period. 
Reservation Process 
Any group or individual who wishes to distribute printed material or collect signatures at an indoor location on 
campus must complete the Distribution of Printed Materials Reservation form. Copies of reservation forms are 
available       in       the       Office       of       Student       Life,       SSC       1217       and       online       at 
http://www.cod.edu/student_life/print_guidelines.aspx.  
The reservation forms must be turned in to Student Life at least four business days prior to the requested 
date of distribution. Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to attach copies of the materials to be 
distributed or displayed to the reservation form. 
The College will respond to reservations within four business days. 
Approval to distribute printed materials or collect signatures will not be based on the content of the printed 
materials or petition. Approval is required only to assure non-interference with the ongoing programs or 
regular business of the College.
