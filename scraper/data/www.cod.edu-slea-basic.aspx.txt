BASIC ACADEMY

In order to attend the Suburban Law Enforcement Academy at College of DuPage, a
recruit must be appointed as a police officer or deputy sheriff by an authorized
Law Enforcement Agency that is duly recognized by the Illinois Law Enforcement
Training and Standards Board (ILETSB).

This cost-effective, 16-week program, offered three times a year, applies
diverse training experiences and innovative training strategies to prepare
recruits to be highly qualified officers.

Classroom and practical training are central to the program. All instructors are
state certified and are currently active in their fields of expertise. Students
also are required to take part in several practical scenarios that include
traffic stops, crimes in progress, building searches, court testimony, street
stops and a variety of everyday situations common to police work.

A regularly scheduled strength and aerobic program is conducted during the
academy program. Defensive Tactics, along with other techniques, including
verbal judo, are part of the curriculum.

The firearms program is set up with safety first. All instructors are master
firearms certified and full-time law enforcement officers. To ensure safety, we
maintain a close ratio of students to instructors.
