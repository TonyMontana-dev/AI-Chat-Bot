INTERPRETATION EVENTS

(i.e. dramatic readings where the performer holds a script and uses suggested,
rather than fully realized, performance choices)

 * Dramatic Interpretation: One or more selections of dramatic literature
   (plays, screenplays) by any author(s) from any period are used in a 10-minute
   program. If two or more selections are used, they should be developed around
   a central theme.
 * Poetry Interpretation: One or more poetry selections by any author(s) from
   any period are used in a 10-minute program. If two or more selections are
   used, they should be developed around a central theme.
 * Prose Interpretation: One or more prose selections (novels, short stories,
   etc.) by any author(s) from any period. If two or more selections are used,
   they should be developed around a central theme.
 * Program Oral Interpretation: A thematic program made up of two or more
   selections from two or more literary genres (i.e. prose, poetry, drama). The
   10-minute presentation should include an appropriate introduction and, if
   necessary, transitions.
 * Duo Interpretation: This 10-minute event consists of a team of two persons
   who perform a two-person version of a prose, dramatic interpretation, or
   program oral interpretation. Any genre of literature is permitted and the
   contestants may play two or more characters.
 * Interpreters Theater: The interpretation of a piece or pieces of literature
   by a group of three or more oral readers who act as a medium of expression
   for an audience. All types of literature (poetry, prose and/or drama) may be
   employed. The 25 minute presentation usually remains in the realm of
   suggestion and stimulates the audience's imagination. Movement is used
   liberally.

 


PLATFORM EVENTS

(i.e. public speaking, like you might do in a speech class)

 * Persuasive Speaking: The purpose of this 10-minute event is to convince,
   stimulate, or actuate the audience concerning some significant issue.
 * Informative Speaking: The purpose is to describe, clarify, define or explain
   an object, idea, concept or process.
 * Speech To Entertain: The primary purpose of this 10-minute presentation is to
   entertain. However, as in any speech, there must be a central purpose, theme
   or thesis around which the speech is developed.
 * Communication Analysis: The subject may be a single speech, a single speaker,
   the rhetoric of a movement, or any other legitimate communication event. The
   speaker then analyzes in a 10-minute speech the impact of the subject using
   communication theory found in a journal article or the like.
    


LIMITED PREPARATION EVENTS

(i.e. speaking on a moment's notice)

 * Impromptu Speaking: Topics are of a philosophical nature, usually consisting
   of a single word, a quotation or similar. The contestant selects one of three
   topics drawn and then has a total of seven minutes to prepare and present the
   speech.
 * Extemporaneous Speaking: The contestant is given a choice of three topics
   concerned with national, international, or economic current events occurring
   within the previous 90 days. They then choose a topic and have 30 minutes to
   develop a seven-minute speech. Contestants are allowed to use print materials
   they have brought with them to the tournament.
    


DEBATE EVENTS

(i.e. creating argumentation and speaking at moment’s notice)

 * IPDA (International Public Debate Association) Debate: This debate style
   involves a one-on-one debate. The two debaters choose from a list of 3 or 5
   topics that involve topics of fact, value, or policy nature and are then
   given 30 minutes prepare. In IPDA, debaters are allowed to use documented
   evidence found on the internet within the 30 minutes to formulate their
   arguments and defend their given position on the debate topic. Debates last a
   total of 26 minutes, alternating between debaters.
 * Parliamentary Debate: Teams of two choose from a list of 3 or 5 topics of
   fact, value, or policy nature 15 minutes before the debate is to happen. They
   then formulate arguments and prepare to defend their given side of the
   debate. While parliamentary debaters are not allowed to use documented
   evidence, they can use examples and knowledge afforded to any college student
   to support their arguments. Debates last a total 40 minutes, alternating
   between speakers and teams.
