[https://www.cod.edu/student_life/resources/]Housing Options

As with most community colleges College of DuPage does not provide on-campus
housing or dormitory facilities for students. Although the college does not
offer student housing, the local community and the surrounding region have a
wide range of housing options.


AMERICAN HOMESTAY NETWORK

American Homestay Network is a homestay management company that places
international students with local host families. International students have a
truly American experience by living with a qualified host family. American
Homestay Network offers a number of host living environments – students may be
paired with singles, retirees, traditional families, single parent with children
or high school age kids.

The service conducts extensive screening, training and background checks on all
host families so students are assured a safe and secure living environment. No
contracts are necessary. Apply online at http://myamericanhomestay.org
[http://myamericanhomestay.org/]


APARTMENT OPTIONS

The list below is a small sample of apartments in the area, in no particular
order. Most apartments do not come furnished and will require a security deposit
of some amount. The College does not endorse, nor is responsible for the
information contained on any of the housing sites.
