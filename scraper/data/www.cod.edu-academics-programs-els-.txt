BENEFITS OF ELS

By taking ELS classes, your academic and professional English will improve in
the following areas:

 * Listening
 * Pronunciation/Speaking
 * Reading
 * Grammar
 * Writing
 * Vocabulary

Throughout the program, students will work on developing intercultural
competence and global leadership skills, as well as practice strategies for
lifelong learning. 

All classes have 20 students or fewer, are highly interactive and appropriate
for all ages 18 and older. Morning and evening classes are available Monday to
Thursday.

Students from all over the world choose to enroll in the ELS program because it
is affordable and located near Chicago – the third largest city in the United
States. Degree-applicable credits can easily transfer to thousands of colleges
and universities across the U.S.
