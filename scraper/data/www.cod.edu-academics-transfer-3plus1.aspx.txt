Once you are ready to get started, follow the steps below:

 1. Begin your studies at COD [/admission/index.aspx] in your chosen degree. In
    collaboration with a COD counselor or program advisor, develop an academic
    plan that meets both the articulated Associate degree and transfer program
    requirements.
 2. Complete the 3+1 Transfer Application
    [https://cod.edu/academics/transfer/pdf/3plus1_app.pdf]. Email the completed
    application to 3plus1@cod.edu or dropped it off at the front desk of the
    Counseling, Advising and Transfer office located in Student Services Center
    (SSC) 3200.
 3. Connect with the 3+1 partner school
    [/academics/transfer/events/index.aspx]through a campus visit, advising
    session, or transfer event to ensure you understand program expectations and
    answer your questions. 
 4. Submit an official admission application one to two semesters before you
    complete your degree at COD. You'll need to request your official COD
    transcripts [/academics/transfer/events/index.aspx] to be sent directly to
    the transfer destination.  
 5. Apply to graduate [/records/forms/application-degree-certificate.aspx] with
    an Associate degree identified in the 3+1 program map. After grades and

 6. Once admitted into your 3+1 school, meet with an advisor to discuss the
    registration process. If you have applied for financial aid, you must
    activate a Consortium Agreement allowing your third-year courses to be paid
    for by the 3+1 school. You must be accepted into the 3+1 school before
    starting your third-year courses.
