ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS

   [/admission/international/admissions-requirements.aspx]
 * Estimated Expenses [/admission/international/expenses.aspx]
 * English Proficiency [/admission/international/english_proficiency.aspx] 
 * Resources [/admission/international/resources.aspx]

All the materials listed below must be submitted before a decision is made
regarding your application.

The processing time for an I-20 document is approximately two to three weeks
from the date your completed application is received.

Application

The prospective student must complete all sections of the International I-20
Application online [https://admissions.cod.edu/]. You must make sure to provide
your home address (non-U.S. address) along with information about where you will
be living while attending College of DuPage.

If you start an application that requires the Social Security Number to be
populated, then you have started the incorrect application. You will need to log
back into your online profile and select the "International I-20 application".

It is very important that the online application be completed by the prospective
student, to avoid further delays to the admission process. 

Application Fee

An application fee must be paid online upon submitting the International I-20
Application. This fee is not refundable nor applicable toward tuition. Visit the
Admissions Policies page [/admission/admissions_policies.aspx] for application
fee information.

Photograph

Submit one recently taken photograph with your application.

Autobiographical Statement
Submit a one-page essay in English describing your academic background,
educational objectives and professional or career goals. Please include in the
letter the living arrangements you have made for the duration of your studies at
the College of DuPage.
Educational Credentials

The minimum academic requirement for international admission is proof of
graduation from an accredited secondary (high) school. Please upload to your
online application your credentials showing completion of higher secondary
school to College of DuPage, plus official transcripts from any colleges or
universities previously attended. Faxed or email copies are NOT acceptable.

If original credentials are not available in English, an official English
translation must accompany the original document.

It is important to note that not all educational systems are the same so if you
have any questions on what document is required for admission, call or email the
office for additional information.

Copy of Passport

Your passport must be valid and not expired. 

Evidence of Status in the U.S.

visa, provide photocopies of:

 * Most recent visa (even if expired)
 * I-94 
 * I-20 document (if on an F-1 visa) 
 * DS-2019 document (if on a J-1 visa)
 * USCIS Notice of Action approving extension or change of status application 

Evidence of Financial Support

sponsor can be family, friends or a company from the U.S. or outside the U.S.

    this link [/admission/international/pdf/affidavit.pdf].
 2. An official bank statement showing adequate funds to cover the estimated
    cost of attendance and living expenses for one full academic year. A clear
    scan of the official document can be uploaded directly to the students
    online application. The predetermined amount that you or your sponsor must
    provide is stated on our Estimated Expense page
    [https://cod.edu/admission/international/expenses.aspx]. The financial
    statement must have been issued within the last five months. If you are
    being sponsored by a company, the sponsor's name must be on the bank
    statement or an additional bank letter must be provided.

English Proficiency

The TOEFL iBT or IELTS will be required for admission to the College of DuPage
for both the Academic programs and the English Language Studies (ELS). For more
