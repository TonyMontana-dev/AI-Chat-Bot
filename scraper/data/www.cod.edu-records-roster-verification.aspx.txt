Students are expected to attend all classes for which they are registered.
Before financial aid is disbursed, COD must be able to document that you have
begun demonstrating attendance or participated in class. This reporting ensures
accurate census counts and reduces the risk for financial and academic penalties
for students who are not immediately engaged in their classes. This information
is received from faculty members at the start of the semester.


ATTENDANCE VERIFICATION PROCESS


ON CAMPUS COURSES

Your instructors will verify your attendance or participation in an academic
activity. It is imperative that you respond if the instructor calls your name
during roll call to confirm your attendance. If you are absent or register for a
course late, check-in with your instructor so your attendance can be verified.
If you are not attending or actively engaged in your course, you will be
withdrawn from the class.


ONLINE COURSES

To complete roster verification for online courses, a faculty member will assign
and collect an academic activity at the beginning of the semester to verify your
attendance. This task must be completed in order for the faculty member to
verify your attendance. Logging into Blackboard is not enough to verify your
attendance.

For compliance, COD is required to remove students who are not attending or
actively participating in courses. You will receive an email from the Office of
Financial Aid if adjustments are necessary. If you receive this email
notification and believe that the roster verification needs to be
corrected/updated, contact your instructor. If the record is updated, your aid
will be reinstated. COD will actively monitor roster confirmation processes.

Financial Aid will monitor the roster verification process and if necessary,
make downward adjustments to aid. If you are borrowing student loans, you must
be confirmed in at least six credit hours. State Grant programs and some
scholarships require you to be confirmed in at least 12 full-time credit hours.
Federal Pell Grants allow for part-time study at reduced award amounts.


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FOR STUDENTS

I received an email that said I wasn’t attending my classes. What does this
mean?

Your instructors are required to actively confirm that you are participating in
your online course or have begun attending the courses for which you will
receive financial aid. If you received an email indicating you were not
attending you should review the course(s) listed and the status that was
reported. Speak with or email the faculty member listed in the email to ensure
they know that you are in fact attending classes.

My instructor reported me as not attending, but I have been. What should I do?

It is important that you speak with your instructor as soon as possible to
establish your attendance in the course. You will need to request a permit to
re-enroll after being withdrawn.

My instructor reported me as not attending, but now has updated my status. What
happens next?

We monitor the roster verification process and will adjust your financial aid
accordingly if an error was made in reporting your attendance status. .

My financial aid did not disburse in the amounts that I expected. What happened?

The most common reason for this is that you are not enrolled full-time. The next
most common reason will be that your attendance in one or more of your classes
has not been confirmed.

What is academic engagement?

Academic engagement is determined by a student's participation in at least one
academically related activity. The following are some examples of acceptable
academically related activities:

 * Physically attended the course (does not apply to 100% online courses)
 * Submitted an academic assignment
 * Completed an interactive tutorial
 * Initiated contact with the instructor to ask a question about the academic
   subject matter
 * Participated in computer-assisted instruction
 * Submitted an exam or quiz
 * Participated in an online discussion about academic matters
 * Participated in any other academically related activity

Academically related activities do NOT include:

 * Logging into an online class without active participation
 * Participating in academic counseling or advisement


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS FOR FACULTY

Where do I report Roster Verification?

Roster Verification is completed within Blackboard using the Academic Records
Integration tool.

When do I report Roster Verification?

The deadline for Roster Verification depends on the start date and length of the
course. You will receive an email when it is time for you to enter this data. Do
not enter verification information before you receive the email or it will be
erased.

How is this attendance tied to federal regulations?

Federal regulations require that a school be able to document that a student
began attendance, and when they ceased attendance. Students may receive
financial aid only for courses where they have been confirmed attending.

What if I report a student as not attending but discover that I made a mistake?

If you make a mistake on the Roster Verification, you can make the change until
the due date for that course. Once the due date has passed, you must contact the
Office of Student Records or use the Roster Verification Correction Form on the
InsideCOD portal. Students who have been reported as non-attending and have been
removed can re-enroll with your permission.  The student will need to request a
Late Registration permit from you, and you will need to complete the Roster
Verification Correction Form.  Though you will be able to make the change in the
Academic Records Integration tool, the change will not be recorded by the
Student Information System after the due date has passed.
