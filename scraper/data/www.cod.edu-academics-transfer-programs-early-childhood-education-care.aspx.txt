Care Transfer Opportunities


EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND CARE TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES

College of DuPage has partnered with several transfer institutions to provide
opportunities for students to complete a bachelor's degree in the early
childhood field. Students should make an appointment with a faculty member,
counselor or a program advisor to discuss these transfer opportunities.

Early Childhood Access Consortium for Equity (IL Public Act 102-0174)

As of July 28, 2021, the Early Childhood Access Consortium for Equity (ECACE)
has established that the AAS in ECE, from an entitled Illinois community
college, transfers in full to all Illinois state public universities and the
private universities that are part of the ECACE.  *This is similar to a 2+2.

Students who successfully complete the full AAS in Early Childhood Education and
the Level 4 Gateways Credential (all ECEC courses must be passed with a 'C' or
better) and have an overall 2.0GPA or better on a 4.0 scale, will be granted
junior level status in the university early childhood program upon transfer and
will not be required to repeat courses or take additional credit hours beyond
what is required of original baccalaureate students unless pursuing additional
endorsements on the student's Professional Educator License (PEL).

All Illinois public universities, and some Illinois private universities, are
held to the requirements of Public Act 102-0174.  A list of those universities
that accept the full Associate in Applied Science in Early Childhood Education
with the Level 4 Gateways Credential can be found through the Early Childhood
Access Consortium For Equity.

Transfer Guides

Articulation Agreements and Guaranteed Admissions Programs are not the only ways
that students can transfer. College of DuPage courses are designed to transfer
to many different institutions. Transfer guides are available to aid students in
this process.

Transfer guides suggest specific College of DuPage course subjects that meet
prerequisites for specific majors. These guides also provide contact
information, basic information about the major, admission & degree requirements,
general education requirements and transfer policies. Explore transfer guides
[/academics/transfer/colleges/index.aspx] by transfer institution.

TRANSFER PLANNING

Deciding on a college or university to finish your studies is an important
decision. To assist you in this decision process we have collected the following
resources. Please know that these links are not a part of College of DuPage and
are provided as a service and no endorsement is expressed or implied.

 * Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI)
   [https://itransfer.org/aboutiai/index.php]
   The Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) is a statewide transfer agreement,
   which is transferable among more than 100 participating college or
   universities in Illinois. 
 * Transferology [https://www.transferology.com/school/cod]
   This online tool will help you identify colleges and universities that will
   accept your transfer courses. Be sure to check out the videos posted on the
   website to learn more about utilizing this tool.
 * Attend a Transfer Event [/academics/transfer/events/index.aspx]
   Many colleges and universities participate in on-campus events to highlight
   transfer opportunities.
 * Guaranteed Transfer Admission Programs
   [/academics/transfer/guaranteed-transfer-admission.aspx]
   Explore schools that offer Guaranteed Transfer Admissions to College of
   DuPage students. Students can apply to any school of their choosing, but COD
   partners with a select number of schools that guarantee admission to students
   who meet specific criteria.
