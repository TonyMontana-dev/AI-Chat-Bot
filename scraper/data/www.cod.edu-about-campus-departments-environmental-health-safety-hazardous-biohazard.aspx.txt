BIOHAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Bloodborne Pathogen training is required annually by OSHA for employees that
have the potential to be exposed to blood or body fluids through their daily
assignments. Contact the EHS/Risk management department for the current training
schedule. The COD Exposure Control Plan is available to employees on the EHS
Guidelines page
[/about/campus-departments/environmental-health-safety/safety-guidelines.aspx].

Bloodborne pathogen exposures, needle sticks, or instrument breakage incidents
must be reported as soon as possible. Complete the incident form
[/about/campus-departments/environmental-health-safety/pdf/bloodborne_pathogen_form.pdf] and
follow the instructions for submittal.

Biohazardous wastes are collected every other month. EHS will distribute an
email notification to identified generators prior to the collection date. Make
sure that all containers are securely closed. Bags should not contain materials
that could puncture them. Sharps containers should be firmly closed with tabs
snapped into place.


HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Specialty training is required for any employee that is required to work with,
or around, hazardous materials. Contact the EHS/Risk management. department for
the current training schedule. All Plans and Guidelines associated with
hazardous material activity on campus are available to employees on the EHS
Guidelines page
[/about/campus-departments/environmental-health-safety/safety-guidelines.aspx].

If anyone should receive an exposure to a hazardous material (injury or not) the
incident must be documented so that EHS can insure that the individual can
receive appropriate medical attention, or the process or area can be modified to
remove the hazard. Complete a COD Incident report
[/about/campus-departments/environmental-health-safety/forms.aspx].


DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

Hazardous wastes, unusable products, and unwanted chemicals are collected from
around the main campus on a regular basis. An email notification is sent out to
identified departments requiring a disposal inventory be completed to identify
the materials they have ready for disposal. It is recommended that employees
review the Hazardous Material Waste Disposal Inventory Form.
[/about/campus-departments/environmental-health-safety/pdf/haz_mat_waste_disposal_inventory.pdf]


GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AUDITS

The EHS department conducts regular audits of departments that use or store
hazardous materials (including compressed gas cylinders) to insure that they are
in compliance with COD policies as well as State and Federal regulations
regarding the safe storage, handling and disposal of these materials.

GHS/HAZARDOUS COMMUNICATION STANDARD INFORMATION

In 2013 changes were made to this OSHA standard in order to align the United
States worker's Right to Know requirements with the United Nations Globally
Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of chemicals, or GHS. These
changes ensured that the evaluation and understanding of hazardous materials
were consistent and that labels and safety data sheets were more accurate and
easier to read.
