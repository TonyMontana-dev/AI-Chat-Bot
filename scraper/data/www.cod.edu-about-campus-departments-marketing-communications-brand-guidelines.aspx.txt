A brand is more than a logo or a name. It's the way we tell our story and the
experience people have with College of DuPage.

Our new brand guidelines are the tools we use to tell our stories and reinforce
those experiences; they are the touchstone for looking, speaking and acting as
one College.

Each and every point of contact we have with our audiences—students, faculty,
staff, alumni, donors and community—builds a perception about who we are as a
college, what we are doing to fulfill our mission, and why we are important to
our community.

With consistent use, these guidelines will create a unified voice and vision
that support our goal to be recognized as the primary college district residents
choose for high quality education.
