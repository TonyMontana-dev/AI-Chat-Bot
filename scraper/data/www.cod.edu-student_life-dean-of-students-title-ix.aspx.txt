   [/student_life/dean-of-students/title-ix.aspx]

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in
education programs and activities at all colleges and universities that receive
federal funding. Sex discrimination includes sexual harassment and sexual
assault and violence. Sex discrimination, including sex and gender-based
violence, is never acceptable and is a violation of College of DuPage as well as
state and federal law.


COLLEGE OF DUPAGE’S TITLE IX SERVICES INCLUDE

 * Maintaining an institutional commitment to non-discrimination. College of
   DuPage is committed to maintaining a respectful and professional academic and
   work environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors. This includes
   having an environment free from unlawful sexual misconduct and interpersonal
   violence. This applies to all settings and activities of the College, whether
   on campus property or off, if the misconduct adversely affects the health,
   safety, or security of any member of the college community or the interests
   of the college. This covers all students, employees and other individuals who
   have a relationship with College of DuPage that enables the College to
   exercise some control over the individual’s conduct in places and activities
   that relate to the College’s work.
 * Educating the campus community and disseminating established Sexual
   Harassment procedures and best practices
   [/student_life/dean-of-students/sexual-harassment.aspx]. College of DuPage
   does this to preserve campus safety and ensure compliance with federal laws,
   including the Campus Save Act in against sex discrimination, including sexual
   assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking.
 * Providing prevention training and ongoing awareness programs for students,
   employees and the College community.
 * Providing campus and community resources and referrals for involved parties
   of sex discrimination and sex- or gender-based misconduct.
