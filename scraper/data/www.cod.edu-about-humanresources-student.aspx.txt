 * Student Employment [/about/humanresources/student.aspx]

For many students, part-time employment is the beginning of a record that will
not only follow the student through college but also out into the working world
after graduation.

Students should look at college employment as a chance to build a positive work
record that may be used in the future to obtain employment.

It may also be advantageous for you to apply for financial aid to assist you
with meeting your educational goals. This may also include being eligible for
the Federal Work Study program [/costs/financial_aid/federal-work-study.aspx].

Find out if you are eligible and put student employment to work for you!


EMPLOYMENT CRITERIA

 * Students should be enrolled in at least six hours of college-level courses or
   acceptable remedial courses. The credit hours must be 1000-level and above or
   remedial courses that qualify for financial aid.
 * Students should carry at least six credit hours each term. The credit hour
   requirement may vary during summer semesters. Check with the Office of
   Student Financial Assistance [/costs/financial_aid/index.aspx].
 * Students must have and maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a
   4.0 scale and must not be on disciplinary probation.
 * Students who have financial aid awards must meet the Standards of Academic
   Progress.
 * During fall and spring semesters, student employees should not exceed 20
   hours of work per week.
