NEW EARLY ADMISSIONS STUDENTS

Toggle Sub-navigation
 * New Early Admission Students
   [/academics/academic_opportunities/high_school_students/new.aspx]
 * Returning Early Admission Students
   [/academics/academic_opportunities/high_school_students/returning.aspx]


STEP 1: REVIEW EARLY ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES

 * Be under the age of 18 without a high school diploma or GED.
 * A cumulative minimum GPA of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale or 3.75 on a 5.0 scale.
 * The Admissions & Outreach Office must seek Dean approval for students under
   the age of 16 to enroll in Early Admission classes.
 * Early Admission is not guaranteed and is approved on a case-by-case basis.
   Additionally, recommendations from a high school counselor or legal guardian
   does not guarantee acceptance into the Early Admissions program. 
 * Early Admissions students are not eligible to register for Field Studies and
   Study Abroad classes. 
 * Approval for a class load of more than one course for the first semester will
   only be granted in exceptional cases.
 * The grades earned for courses taken as an Early Admissions student will be
   permanent and recorded on the College of DuPage transcript.


STEP 2: GET ADMITTED AND SET UP STUDENT ACCOUNTS

 * Submit your online admissions application [https://admissions.cod.edu/].
   NOTE: Use full-legal name and a personal email address. Do not use a general
   family account.
 * Once you submit your application, we will create your COD Username and send
   it to your personal email. An email titled “COD Student Portal Username” will
   contain your COD Username and information on setting up your password and
   accessing your student email account.
 * Setup your student email account
   [/student_life/resources/information_technology/email/index.aspx].
 * Learn about tuition and fees [/costs/tuition/index.aspx].


STEP 3: SELECT COURSE, MEET COURSE PREREQUISITE (IF ANY) AND SELECT COURSE
SECTION

 * If you need help selecting courses, we recommend students use the Associate
   in Arts or the Associate in Science Worksheet as a point of reference. Both
   options are designed for students who plan to transfer to a
   baccalaureate-granting school to pursue a bachelor’s degree. The Student
   Planning Worksheets
   [/student_life/resources/counseling/academic-advising/student-planning.aspx]
   outline the courses and degree requirements necessary to complete a desired
   degree.
 * Review the Course Catalog [https://catalog.cod.edu/courses-a-z/] to
   familiarize yourself with course description and prerequisite information.
   Early Admissions applicants must meet all course prerequisites prior to
   submitting the Early Admission Form. For more information on meeting course
   prerequisites, visit the Math Placement
   [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/math/] and the Reading and
   Writing Placement
   [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/reading/index.aspx] page.
   Placement tests help identify your academic skill level so you are placed and
   enrolled in the correct courses to achieve academic success.
 * Search the current schedule of classes
   [/registration/myaccess-student-planning.aspx] without login to find course
   section: date, time, and format.


STEP 4: SUBMIT SUPPLEMENTAL EARLY ADMISSION FORM AND REQUEST APPROVAL

 * Student must complete and email supplemental Early Admission Form
   [/academics/academic_opportunities/high_school_students/pdf/eastudentpermitfill.pdf]
   and an updated copy of their unofficial transcript to admissions@cod.edu.
   [admissions@cod.edu]NOTE: At the college level all communication is sent
   directly to the student. Students should communicate via the email address
   provided on the application. Students are welcome to include their legal
   guardian in email communication.
 * At this step, the Admission & Outreach Office will determine if the student
   is approved to enroll as an Early Admission student. If a student is
   approved, the Admission & Outreach Office will guide the student through the
   next steps to register for classes. Early Admission students are not able to
   register via online registration, students must be added to the class roster
   by the Registration Office.


STEP 5: PAY FOR TUITION AND GET READY TO START YOUR COD JOURNEY

 * Review the payment policy and explore payment options.
   [/costs/tuition/payment-plans/index.aspx]
