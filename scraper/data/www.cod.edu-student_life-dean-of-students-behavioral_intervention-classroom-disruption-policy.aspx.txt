 * Responding to Students with Possible Behaviors of Concern
   [/student_life/dean-of-students/behavioral_intervention/response.aspx]

During recent years, we have seen an increase in the number and severity of
incidents of classroom disruption, whether the classroom is online or held in
person. The classroom could also extend to those course-related discussions
between an instructor and a student during office hours. The Dean of Students
Office offers the following advisory to assist instructors who may encounter a
disruptive student.

 * Classroom disruption is seen as misconduct, as defined by College of DuPage’s
   Code of Student Conduct. Classroom disruption is behavior a reasonable person
   would view as substantially or repeatedly interfering with normal class
   activities. Examples include repeatedly leaving and entering the classroom
   without authorization, making loud or distracting noises, persisting in
   speaking without being recognized, or resorting to physical threats or
   personal insults.
 * An instructor is responsible for management of the classroom environment.
   Instructors focus on relevant issues, set reasonable time limits, assess the
   quality of ideas and expression, and ensure participants are heard in an
   orderly manner. Instructors need to exercise authority with a sense of
   fairness, and with appreciation for the reality of human fallibility.
   Disruptive conduct may determine a student’s fitness to continue in an
   academic program. Instructors should keep their department chair informed of
   any situation involving student behavior so that the appropriate assessments
   may be made regarding the student’s status.
 * A student has the right to freedom of inquiry, of legitimate classroom
   discussion, and of free expression of his or her opinion, subject to the
   instructor’s responsibilities to maintain order and to complete the course
   requirements.
 * Rudeness, incivility, and disruption are often indistinguishable, though they
   may intersect. Most often, it is better to respond to rudeness by example and
   situation (e.g., advising a student in private that he or she appears to have
   a habit of interrupting others). Rudeness can become disruption when it is
   repetitive, especially after a warning has been given.

Strategies to prevent and respond to disruptive behavior include the following:

 * Share with students your explicit expectations for conduct in the classroom.
   For example, if you want students to raise their hands for permission to
   speak, say so, using reminders, as needed.
 * Serve as a role model for the conduct you expect from students.
 * If instructors believe inappropriate behavior is occurring, offer general
   words of caution, rather than warning a particular student (e.g., we have too
   many conversations at the moment; let’s all focus on the same topic).
 * If the behavior is inappropriate, but not disruptive, speak with the student
   after class.
 * Most students are unaware of distracting habits or mannerisms, and have no
   intent to be offensive or disruptive. Give the student a specific example of
   the behavior you want him or her to modify or eliminate.
 * There may be rare circumstances when it is necessary to speak to a student
   during class about his or her behavior. Try to do so firmly and with respect,
   indicating that further discussion can occur after class. Public arguments
   and harsh language must be avoided.
 * A student who persists in disrupting a class may be directed to leave the
   classroom for the remainder of the class period. Whenever possible, prior
   consultation should be undertaken with the Department Chair and the Dean of
   Students Office (630) 942-2485 to review applicable College procedures.
 * If disruption is serious, and other reasonable measures have failed, the
   class may be adjourned and the College Police called (630) 942-2000.
   Instructors must not use force or threats of force, except in immediate
   self-defense. Prepare a written account of the incident(s). Identify
   witnesses for the College Police, as needed.

The Dean of Students Office can review College conduct procedures, and meet with
accused students formally or informally. It is important to document and report
disruptive incidents promptly, even if they seem minor.
