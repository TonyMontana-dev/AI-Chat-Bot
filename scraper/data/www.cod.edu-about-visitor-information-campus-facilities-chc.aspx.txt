The CHC is connected to the Inn at Water's Edge. The six-room boutique hotel is
focused on students, but run by a professional team.

COD's hospitality program begins at the Culinary & Hospitality Center. The
60,000 square foot LEED certified facility houses the Culinary Arts
[/academics/programs/culinary/index.aspx] programs, hospitality administration
as well as Multimedia Services. 

Students and community members can enjoy the following services:

 * A quick bite to eat at The Culinary Market at Wheat Café
   [/academics/programs/culinary/student-run-dining/culinary-market.aspx].
 * Fine dining at Waterleaf
   [/academics/programs/culinary/student-run-dining/waterleaf/index.aspx] restaurant.
 * A peaceful stay at Inn at Water's Edge [/inn/index.aspx] hotel.

The boutique Inn at Water's Edge hotel boasts six fully-appointed suites, front
desk, laundry services and breakfast room. Hotel and Lodging Management students
play an integral role in the guest experience. 

COD is one of only a few colleges and universities nationwide to house a
professionally operated fine dining restaurant and a six-bedroom boutique hotel
within its educational center. 

Other student areas within the CHC include: 

 * Skills kitchens, fine-dining and casual dining kitchens and Chocolate Room
   for Pastry Arts.
 * Winter Garden Lobby with fireplace and seating.
 * Culinary Amphitheater for guest lectures and cooking demonstrations. 
 * Multimedia TV Studio.
 * Several classrooms and multipurpose meeting room called Silverleaf.

The CHC has been constructed for U.S. Green Building Council's LEED
certification, making it the first culinary learning facility in the nation to
achieve this prestigious designation. Our programs are accredited by the
Education Foundation of the American Culinary Federation, making COD one of the
few schools in the nation to have accreditation for both food service
administration and culinary arts. 

Completed in fall of 2011, this $25 million facility was funded through proceeds
from a successful 2002 capital referendum.
