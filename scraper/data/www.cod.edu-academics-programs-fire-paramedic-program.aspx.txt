College of DuPage offers paramedic training, an Associate in Applied Science
degree in Emergency Medical Services
[https://catalog.cod.edu/programs-study/fire-science/emergency-medical-services-aas/]
and a Paramedic certificate
[https://catalog.cod.edu/programs-study/fire-science/paramedic-certificate/]
programs through partnerships with all Illinois EMS Region 8 Resource Hospitals:

 * Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital
 * Edward Hospital
 * Loyola University Medical Center
 * Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital


PROGRAM APPLICATIONS

Currently, there are no applications available. The Good Samaritan Hospital
Paramedic Program application will be posted here for their Fall 2024-Summer
2025 program in early February. The applications for Edward Hospital, Loyola
University Medical Center, and Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital
will post their 2025 program applications here in late April/early May 2024.

Students are strongly encouraged to prepare for paramedic training by completing
Anatomy and Physiology 1500 (or both A&P 1551/571 and 1552/1572), Biomedical
Terminology (HLTHS 1110) and take at least two of the following: Fire 2272
Paramedic Transition, Fire 2285 Trauma Assessment, Fire 2286 Pediatrics, and
Fire 2287 Medical Assessment. These courses will prepare you for paramedic
training and contribute to Continuing Education (CE) hours for NREMT
re-certification and IDPH license renewal.


APPLICATION PACKETS

Each program has their own application packet and required documents. Read each
application packet thoroughly and only submit what is required as additional
documents will not be considered. An application fee is required for each
program and is part of the application steps outlined in each application
packet.

There is an entrance exam for each program followed by interviews for qualified
applicants. Each program is responsible for determining which applicants are
selected for their paramedic training program. All training and education is
completed at the hospital training site and each paramedic training program has
their own start and end dates, class dates and times and approved providers for
field training. 

In addition to a Paramedic Certificate Program, COD also offers an Associate in
Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in Emergency Medical Services.
[https://catalog.cod.edu/programs-study/fire-science/emergency-medical-services-aas/]Transfer
opportunities for Bachelor Degrees in Emergency Medical Services and Healthcare
Management are also available.
