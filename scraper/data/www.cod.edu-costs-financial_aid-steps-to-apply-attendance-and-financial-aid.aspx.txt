When you receive financial assistance, whether through grants or loans, you are
expected to attend and be academically engaged for the entire semester. Changing
your schedule, such as adding a class, dropping a class, failing a class or not
attending a class may affect your financial aid for the current and future
semesters. 


FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Your attendance can have a significant impact on your financial aid. Find
answers to the most common questions.

If I register for a class late, how will it affect my financial assistance?

Classes added after the census date (end of the 50 percent refund period), even
with a permit from the instructor, will not be included in determining your
financial assistance disbursement.

Refer to your student schedule in myACCESS for specific refund dates or contact
Student Registration Services [/registration/index.aspx] at (630) 942-2377.

If I want to drop a class, how will it affect my financial assistance?

This depends on at what point in the term the class is dropped. 


CLASS DROPPED DURING 100% REFUND PERIOD

 * Refund periods vary for each class ‐ please refer to your student schedule in
   myACCESS for specific refund dates
 * You will not be charged tuition for the class
 * The class(es) dropped during refund period are not included in financial aid
   eligibility


CLASS DROPPED DURING 50% REFUND PERIOD

 * Refund periods vary for each class ‐ please refer to your student schedule in
   myACCESS for specific refund dates
 * You will be charged 50% tuition for the class
 * The class(es) dropped during refund period are not included in financial aid
   eligibility


CLASS DROPPED AFTER THE REFUND PERIOD (WITHDRAWAL)

 * You are charged full tuition for the class
 * Financial aid is not reduced, unless you are reported as not attending the
   class
 * You will receive a “W” grade for the class(es) on your transcript
 * Affects SAP completion rate


ALL CLASSES DROPPED OR FAILED DURING A TERM

 * We are required to apply a federally mandated formula to determine how much
   of the federal funding was "earned" up to the time of withdrawal. This review
   and recalculation is called a "Return of Title IV Funds"   
 * The amount to be returned will be calculated from the date on which you
   officially withdrew from classes and/or stopped attending.


CLASS REPORTED AS NON‐ATTEND

 * Attendance in classes is required to receive Federal financial aid, and will
   be monitored throughout the term.  If your instructor reports that you have
   not attended your class prior the census date, you will be ineligible to
   receive financial aid funds for this class.   
   * Example: You are enrolled in 12 credit hours, but are reported as
     non‐attend for one of your 3 credit hour classes.  Your financial aid
     eligibility will change from 12 credit hours to 9 credit hours.  

**Important: Withdrawing from classes can affect your future financial aid
eligibility.  Read the following information regarding Standards of Academic
Progress (SAP).
[/costs/financial_aid/policies/satisfactory-academic-progress.aspx]

Refer to your student schedule in MyACCESS for specific refund dates or contact
the Registration Office at (630) 942-2377. Actual disbursement amount will be
based on your enrollment status
[/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/financial-documents-forms/pdf/amounts_enrollment.pdf].

If my instructor marks me as Non-Attend, how will it affect my financial
assistance?
 * In accordance with Federal Regulations, your financial assistance must be
   reviewed and adjusted for any class reported that you are not attending.
   Federal Regulations require active participation in class to be eligible for
   Federal funds.
 * Your Pell Grant eligibility must be adjusted to reflect only classes in which
   you are academically engaged. The Pell Grant is reduced for any classes that
   are reported as Non Attend.
 * Federal Direct Loans will have no additional disbursements made if it is
   determined that you are attending less than six eligible credit hours.
 * If you have not attended any of your classes for the semester, you will risk
   losing all of your financial assistance for the semester. 

Can my attendance in class affect my financial assistance?
 * If you receive financial assistance, but never attend classes, the Office of
   Student Financial Assistance must return all disbursed funds to their
   respective federal aid programs (this applies to grants and loans). You are
   considered attending if you have been engaging in academic related activities
   pertaining to your classes. Federal assistance must be reduced for any class
   reported as non attend, which may result in a balance due to the school.
 * Examples of an academic related activity are:
   * Exams or quizzes
   * Completion of an academic assignment, paper or project
   * Participating in an online discussion about academic matters
   * Initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question about the
     academic subject studied in the course
 * You will be notified via your COD email if financial assistance was adjusted
   due to non attend.

If I have to drop all of my classes, how will it affect my financial assistance?
 * Federal Regulations require Title IV financial assistance funds to be awarded
   under the assumption that you will attend the institution for the entire
   period in which federal assistance was awarded. When you withdraw from all
   courses for any reason, including medical withdrawals, you may no longer be
   eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that you were originally
   scheduled to receive. The Return of Title IV Funds Policy is based upon the
   premise that students earn their financial assistance in proportion to the
   amount of time in which they are enrolled.
 * Based on this calculation, College of DuPage students who receive federal
   financial assistance and do not complete their classes during a semester
   could be responsible for repaying a portion of the aid they received.
 * If it is determined that funds must be returned to the Department of
   Education, a notification letter outlining the amount returned to the federal
   program(s) will be mailed to the student's address on file. College of DuPage
   will return funds on the student's behalf to the appropriate federal aid
   program(s) and the student’s account will be billed for any amount due as a
   result of the return of federal aid funds. The student is responsible for all
   charges and overpayments resulting from a Return of Title IV calculation.

If I fail a class, how will it affect my financial aid?
 * Federal Regulations require Title IV financial assistance funds to be awarded
   under the assumption that you will attend the institution for the entire
   period in which federal assistance was awarded. When you withdraw from all
   courses for any reason, including medical withdrawals, you may no longer be
   eligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that you were originally
   scheduled to receive. The Return of Title IV Funds Policy is based upon the
   premise that students earn their financial assistance in proportion to the
   amount of time in which they are enrolled.
 * Based on this calculation, College of DuPage students who receive federal
   financial assistance and do not complete their classes during a semester
   could be responsible for repaying a portion of the aid they received.
 * If it is determined that funds must be returned to the Department of
   Education, a notification letter outlining the amount returned to the federal
   program(s) will be mailed to the student's address on file. College of DuPage
   will return funds on the student's behalf to the appropriate federal aid
   program(s) and the student's account will be billed for any amount due as a
   result of the return of federal aid funds. The student is responsible for all
   charges and overpayments resulting from a Return of Title IV calculation.

If I get an incomplete grade, how will it affect my financial aid?

Incomplete grades are not included in GPA or credits earned. Once the incomplete
is replaced with a final grade, the class will be included in GPA and credits
earned and will be included for Satisfactory Academic Progress.

If I take a class pass or fail, how will it affect my financial aid?
 * Students who enroll in classes as a Pass/Fail will either receive a “S” grade
   or a “F” grade.
 * The Grade of S will not affect a student’s GPA, however, it will count
   towards total attempted hours. A grade of S will be counted as completed
   coursework.
 * The Grade of F will affect a student’s GPA and it will count towards total
   attempted hours. However, the grade of F will be not be counted as completed
   coursework.
 * Classes taken as Pass/Fail will affect Satisfactory Academic Progress. All
   Pass/Fail courses count as attempted hours towards a student’s completion
   rate.

If I need to repeat a class, how will it affect my financial aid?
 * Students who receive a W or F grade in a course are eligible to receive
   financial aid for repeating the course until receiving a passing grade (D or
   better), as long as the student is meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress
   standards.
 * Students who receive a passing grade in a course (D or better) can repeat the
   course one more time and receive financial aid.
 * Repeated courses affect Satisfactory Academic Progress. All repeated courses
   count as attempted hours towards a student’s completion rate.

Withdraws, fails, and incomplete grades can affect your Satisfactory Academic
Progress

FINANCIAL AID TIPS

 1. Withdraws, fails and incomplete grades can affect your Satisfactory Academic
    Progress
    [/costs/financial_aid/steps-to-apply/general-eligibility-requirements.aspx](SAP).
    This means you may lose your financial aid eligibility at College of DuPage
    and may need to file an appeal to have your eligibility reinstated.
 2. Before you drop any classes, be sure to contact the Office of Student
    Financial Assistance [/costs/financial_aid/index.aspx] to ensure it will not
    affect your financial aid.
