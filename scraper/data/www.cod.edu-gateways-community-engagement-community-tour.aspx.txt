College of DuPage welcomes you to experience the beauty and energy of the campus
throughout the year.  From attending a football game, to enjoying a concert or
rambling through the prairie, there are so many exciting things to see and do! 

We also provide a limited number of specialized tours for student and community
groups. Visit dates are determined based on mutual availability. School groups
may visit once per semester. High School students interested in a traditional
campus overview should visit cod.edu/visit [/admission/visit_cod/] to schedule a
tour.
