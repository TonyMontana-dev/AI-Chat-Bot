The program is open to anyone who has a strong interest in immersing themselves
in another culture. Qualified high school seniors 18 and over may be accepted
into the program. Community members are welcome.


ORIENTATION

A mandatory pre-departure orientation will be held at College of DuPage. This
typically occurs on a Saturday in May.


LANGUAGE CLASSES

All students are required to enroll in a French language class, held at the
Alliance Francaise, Bordeaux-Aquitaine. Classes accommodate students at
Elementary French I and II, Intermediate French I and II, and Advanced French I
and II. Prior to the beginning of classes, all students will be tested and
placed at the appropriate level. Changes can be made if a student progresses at
a faster rate or shows different learning needs.


CIVILIZATION AND CULTURE OF FRANCE

All students are required to enroll in this class, which covers the geography,
history, political and social institutions and the art and architecture of
France. This class first meets at the mandatory orientation session.

In France, the course will continue with guided cultural excursions to theaters,
museums and other places of interest that are integral components of this class,
and therefore, attendance is required. Written assignments are required.


PROGRAM DIRECTORS/FACULTY

All language classes will be taught by instructors at the Alliance Francaise,
Bordeaux-Aquitaine. The Civilization and Culture of France class will be taught
in English by the COD Program Directors/Faculty, who are available daily to
counsel, supervise and assist students.


DIRECTOR

Anna Serrano [serranoa902@cod.edu?subject=Study%20Abroad] is Assistant Professor
of French and Italian at the College of DuPage. She holds a Master’s degree in
French from Northern Illinois University, and she is currently working on a
Master’s degree in Italian at DePaul University. She holds Teaching Certificates
for French, Italian, and Spanish for grades K-12 in Illinois. During her
undergraduate studies, Anna earned awards such as the Exemplary Student Teacher
Award and the Outstanding Woman Award. 

Prior to working at the College of DuPage, she spent several years working at
the high school level and planned and led several trips abroad to France,
including cities such as Paris, Nice, Avignon, and the Loire Valley. Anna grew
up in a bilingual household of English and Italian and caught the “travel-bug”
early on in life, having spent every other summer visiting family in southern
Italy. She enjoys spending time with her husband, two children and chocolate
lab, Jo. 


CREDITS

Upon successful completion of classes, students will receive credit for
Elementary, Intermediate or Advanced French (3-4 semester credit hours)
depending on placement, and Civilization and Culture of France
(3 semester credit hours.)


HOUSING AND MEALS

Students will be housed in carefully selected French homes. They will be
provided with breakfast and dinner while at the home stay. Home stays provide
the opportunity to practice speaking French and to share in the everyday life of
the family.

program.


OPTIONAL EXCURSIONS

Information will be provided on a variety of optional excursions that are not
