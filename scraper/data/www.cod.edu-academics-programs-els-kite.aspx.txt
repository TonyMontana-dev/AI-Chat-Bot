FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

How many times can I take the Kaplan International Tools for English test?

New students are allowed to take the multiple choice and the writing and
speaking test twice. Students must take both parts before retaking the first
part.  

The highest recorded placement score will prevail. Any testing beyond the
allowed frequency can only be initiated by a full-time ELS faculty member or the
Dean of Liberal Arts. 

Do my English language placement tests expire?

Category One scores are permanently valid.  

If a student has scores in categories two to five and has not been taking
classes, it is recommended that they retest after a year.

of DuPage before you begin your placement tests. First-time students to COD have
two chances to take the test. All other students may take the test one time per
year from their last testing date.  You must bring photo identification to the
Testing Center.
