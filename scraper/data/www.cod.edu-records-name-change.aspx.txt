Your name on your official academic record must match your legal name. Your
financial aid and eligibility for future financial aid may be in jeopardy if the
name on your Social Security card does not match your academic record. Your
legal name must appear on official transcripts, tax forms, employment documents
and enrollment verifications.

Both The Testing Center and Cashier's Office require that your photo ID
match the name on your academic record.

If your name has changed or you need to correct the spelling of your name,
paperwork is processed through Student Records. Documentation must be provided
to Student Records either in person, electronically or by mail.


REQUIRED INFORMATION

All name change requests must include:

 * Driver’s License or State Identification Card with a new name; OR
 * Marriage Certificate and photo ID; OR
 * Order of Name Change signed by the courts and photo ID


NAME SPELLING CORRECTIONS

All name spelling correction requests must include:

 * A photo ID showing the correct spelling; a driver’s license, state ID or
   passport.


SUBMIT NAME CHANGE REQUESTS

Submit name change request documentation to Student Records at
recordsoffice@cod.edu [recordsoffice@cod.edu] or mail to:

College of DuPage, Office of Student Records
Student Resource Center (SRC), Room 2150
425 Fawell Blvd
Glen Ellyn, IL 60137

Your academic record, which includes class rosters available to your
instructor(s) and your official transcript will be updated with your new name or
spelling correction within two business days. You will need to notify your
instructor(s) of your new name as soon as possible. If your instructors do not
recognize your name on their roster, they may drop you from their class or issue
an ‘F’ grade. Your username for inside.cod.edu [https://inside.cod.edu/],
myACCESS, Blackboard, and dupage.edu accounts will be updated through the
Information Technology Department.

If you have Financial Aid, your name in the system must match the name on your
social security card or your current aid and eligibility for future aid may be
in jeopardy. The name change you’ve requested will be processed, but it is your
responsibility to update all your legal documents.

Your myAccess username and dupage.edu email address will not be changed if the
term has already started. 

 * The change will be done during the semester break, once final grades have
   been posted for all of your courses
 * If you have an ‘Incomplete’ grade, the change will not be made until the
   final grade has been updated
 * It is imperative that you move any emails prior to the update as they will be
   permanently deleted from the old account. Once your username has been
   updated, you will be contacted by a Student Helpdesk staff member at the
   phone number you provided informing you of your new username for your
   account. 

Continue to use your current username and password for your inside.cod.edu,
myACCESS, Blackboard, and dupage.edu accounts until you are notified that these
accounts will be updated. It is imperative that you move any emails prior to the
update as they will be permanently deleted from the old account. Once your
username has been updated, you will be contacted by a Student Helpdesk staff
member at the phone number you provided informing you of your new username for
these accounts.

NOTE: If the spelling of your last name and first initial remain the same, your
name will be updated but the username for your inside.cod.edu, myACCESS,
Blackboard, and dupage.edu accounts will remain the same.


PREFERRED/CHOSEN NAME

College of DuPage recognizes that students may wish to use a name other than
their legal name to identify themselves.  The preferred/chosen name may appear
on the Class Roster, Blackboard and student portal.

To update your preferred/chosen name, in the student portal, go to MyAccess for
Students >> Select User Account >> Select Personal Contact Information Change
Request >> Update the "Nickname" field with your preferred/chosen name.  This
update will appear the following business day.

Contact the Office of Student Records at (630) 942-2340 if you have any
questions or have circumstances warranting special attention.
