REFUNDS FOR DROPPED COURSES

Toggle Sub-navigation
 * Account Credit Balances [/costs/tuition/refunds/account-credit-balances.aspx]

The last day to drop a registered class and receive a tuition refund is
dependent on the class dates and length of class according to the enrollment
calendar [/student-services/important-dates.aspx].

The 100 percent refund date for a class is the last day you can drop a class and
receive 100 percent of the tuition charges credited for the class, minus fees
for field studies classes. The 50 percent date is the last day you can drop the
class and receive 50 percent of the tuition charges credited for the class. You
can view the exact refund dates for each of your classes by clicking on "My
Class Schedule" in your myACCESS account. If you add or drop a class, it is
recommended you check your myACCESS account to determine the impact on your
account balance.

If you drop a class, you may still be responsible for the cost of tuition and
fees. Dropping a class during the refund period will not result in a "W" on your
transcript. If you are receiving financial assistance, note that dropping one or
more courses may result in an adjustment of aid you receive. Contact Financial
Aid [/costs/financial_aid/contact.aspx] before dropping a class.


TUITION REFUNDS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AND COURSES

Certain classes and fees are non-refundable and may require an appeal. Search by
program or class below or contact Student Registration Services at (630)
942-2377 or email registration@cod.edu [registration@cod.edu]for more
information.

Youth Education
A 100 percent refund is granted for withdrawal up to one day prior to the first
class. Parents must call (630) 942-2208 to request a withdrawal or they will be
charged the full amount. Please note that non-attendance does not count as
withdrawal. If a class is canceled, a complete refund will be issued.
Non-Credit Classes
A 100 percent refund is given if you withdraw up to one calendar day before the
start of your class. Please note that non-attendance does not count as
withdrawal.
Refunds for Field & Interdisciplinary Studies
Trip fees are non-refundable. Travel protection brochures are available in the
Field Studies office [/academics/academic_opportunities/field/index.aspx].
Refunds for Canceled Classes, College Errors
A 100 percent refund is given for a withdrawal that is caused by a canceled
class or a college error. If a substitute class is not taken, a refund for paid
tuition and fees will be issued within two to three weeks.
Medical Appeals

Requests for medical withdrawals should be made to the Dean of Enrollment
Services. Send medical forms to Student Registration Services, SSC 2221, (630)
942-2687.

Requests should be made in writing and accompanied by documentation from a
physician or medical institution to verify the medical condition, date of onset
and estimated length of treatment. Request forms for medical withdrawals
[/registration/pdf/med_withdrawal.pdf] are reviewed individually.

Refunds are issued when appropriate within the guidelines of the College of
DuPage refund policy. You will receive written notification of the decision
within three (3) weeks from the office of the Student Registration Services.

Admission/Recording Fee
The admission/recording fee will not be refunded. Visit the Admissions Policies
[/admission/admissions_policies.aspx] for application fee information.
Lab and Material Fees
Students withdrawing from credit classes that have lab/material fees will
receive 100 percent of the lab/material fees for the first 7 percent of the
session. Lab/material fees will not be refunded after 7 percent of the session.
Credit and Noncredit Class Concurrent Registration
If a student who is registered for both credit and non-credit classes wishes to
withdraw from one class, the refund policy used will be the one appropriate for
the class from which the student is withdrawing.


REFUND APPEALS

Appeals regarding refunds should be submitted through the Office of Student
Registration Services. Visit appeals information
