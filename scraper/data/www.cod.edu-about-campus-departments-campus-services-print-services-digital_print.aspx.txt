PRODUCTION PRINTING SERVICES

Print Services has a variety of digital printing equipment to handle whatever
needs you may have. We offer digital print for:

 * Black and White Printing
 * Color Printing
 * Business Cards
 * Letterhead 
 * Envelopes


ORDERING INFORMATION

 * Business Cards, Envelopes, and Letterhead submission forms are located in the
   Quick Links on the right.
 * Black & White, and Color Printing orders are submitted through our online
   system Job Ticketing [https://printcenter.cod.edu].

 * Instructions for Placing an Order in Job Ticketing
   [/about/campus-departments/campus-services/print-services/pco_instructions.aspx]

When submitting your print orders, to insure accuracy, count each side of an
original document as an ‘original.’ Pricing is based off of the number of
impressions. For example, a Letter sized (8 ½ x 11) print, single sided, is 1
impression. A double sided Letter sized (8 ½ x 11) print is 2 impressions.
Uploading your file and setting your parameters in Job Ticketing will provide
you an accurate quote. If any special instructions are included, the quote will
not reflect any potential extra costs associated with the special request.
