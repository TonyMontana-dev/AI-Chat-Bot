College of DuPage partners with VMock Inc. to help you create a powerful resume
and accelerate your career journey.

VMock, a 24-7 online resume review tool, leverages technologies like
data-science, machine learning, and natural language processing to provide
instant personalized feedback on your resume based on criteria gathered from
employers and global best practices – from anywhere, at any time of the day.

VMock will:

 * Give you an aggregate resume score to assess the strength of your Resume
   benchmarked against your own College of DuPage peer group
 * Provide you with resume guidelines based on your school template to ensure
   that you do not miss the fine details and establish a great first impression
 * Assess how well you have marketed your core competencies to showcase the
   right skill set reflected in academics, experience, achievements etc.
 * Give you line-by-line suggestions to improve your resume content in view of
   your course and level of experience

VMock is designed to work with resumes from many different fields across various
industries. Once you receive the detailed feedback, make relevant changes to the
resume and re-upload it to see the increased score and associated improvements.
