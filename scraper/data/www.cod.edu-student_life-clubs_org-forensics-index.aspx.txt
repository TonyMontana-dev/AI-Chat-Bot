The COD Forensics (Speech and Debate) Team is an excellent opportunity for
students to improve their communication, writing, critical thinking and
performance skills and is open to all students, regardless of major or
performance experience.

Offering four major genres of performance (Public Speaking, Oral Interpretation,
Limited Preparation, and Debate), the Forensics team has something for everyone.
Many students have stated that the speech program is the most involved and
rewarding experience of their college career - and most fun too.

COD STORIES

Marisol Nichols [/about/stories/students/images/marisol_nichols.jpg]

“I received some of the best training of my life on the Forensics Team. It
taught me professionalism and how to put in the work." - Marisol Nichols

Marisol's COD Story [/about/stories/students/nichols.aspx]


COD STORIES

Maggie Yancey [/about/stories/students/images/margaret_yancey.jpg]

“The team consisted of other passionate individuals who were interested in
politics and the news and were self-motivated to propose solutions. I thrived in
this environment because of the relationships I formed with my teammates and
coaches." - Maggie Yancey

Maggie's COD Story [/about/stories/students/yancey.aspx]


COD STORIES

Jim Dobson [/about/stories/students/images/jim_dobson.jpg]

“I was taught a work ethic that helped me stay motivated and complete whatever I
set out to do. I had so much fun on the Forensics team and my success at the
national tournament was a turning point and I wanted to do it forever. So I
did.” - Jim Dobson

Jim's COD Story [/about/stories/students/dobson.aspx]


COD STORIES

Gabbi Gruver [/about/stories/students/images/gabbi-gruver.jpg]

"You can find a club for every interest, be in the Honors program, join a sports
team, study abroad, work on campus and so much more. Don’t let the fact that it
is a community college deter you from making one of the smartest decisions of
your life." - Gabbi Gruver

Gabbi's COD Story [/about/stories/students/gruver.aspx]


COD STORIES

Heidi Bajek [/about/stories/students/images/heidi_bajek.jpg]

“My advice for students considering COD would be to stop considering and just
register. Looking back on it now, there’s no other choice than COD. You have
small class sizes, extremely dedicated and intelligent professors, and a
financially stable start to your college career." - Heidi Bajek
