   score of 250. Send scores to academictesting@cod.edu
   [academictesting@cod.edu].
 * Students who do not meet one of the prerequisites will need to take the
   Guided Self Placement Questionnaire (GSP).

The Guided Self Placement (GSP) is a multiple-choice assessment that asks native
English speakers to self-assess their reading and writing skills and strategies.
The assessment takes approximately 30 to 45 minutes. Questions cover topics such
as a student’s comfort level with college reading and writing processes.
Students also read a short college-level passage and self-assess their
comprehension abilities through multiple-choice comprehension questions. The GSP
does not need to be completed in a COD testing center.

Based on students’ responses, they are provided English course recommendations
and are given a Reading & Writing category score. Students who score below
Category 1 in either Reading or Writing, are required to take developmental
(pre-college) coursework. Students should only take the GSP if they do not meet
one of COD’s other measures for English Placement. To complete the GSP, log on
to the Student Portal [https://inside.cod.edu], click myACCESS for Students, and
then click Guided Self Placement.

Proof of some prerequisites [/records/proof-of-prerequisite.aspx] can be
submitted to the Office of Student Records
[/records/proof-of-prerequisite.aspx].
