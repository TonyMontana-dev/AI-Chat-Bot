 * Students granted an e-permit by the Honors instructor

BECOME AN HONORS SCHOLAR

All Honors sections look great on a transcript, but for students who fulfill the
following requirements, a special “Honors Scholar” designation will be put on
the transcript at graduation. For this, you must:

 * Complete 15 credits of Honors course work including an Honors Seminar, or 18
   credits of Honors course work with or without an Honors Seminar
 * Maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.2 or higher
 * Graduate with a COD degree or certificate

Students who complete 9 or more Honors course credits and maintain a cumulative
GPA of 3.2 have the designation of “Honors Scholar Candidate” on their
transcript, regardless of whether they graduate.
