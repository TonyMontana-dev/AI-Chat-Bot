SUMMER-ONLY STUDENTS

Just because the temperatures are warmer outside doesn't mean your textbook
needs to be closed for the season. There's more than one benefit to enrolling in
a course at College of DuPage during the summer months: 

 1. Get ahead. Ease into the life of a college student by picking up a class
    after you graduate high school or taking an additional course you need to
    fulfill your prerequisites. Even better – after you complete your class,
    you'll be one step closer to graduation.
 2. Lighten your course load. Have some tough classes coming up in the fall?
    Take one this summer and make it easier on yourself next year.
 3. Finish fast. Five and eight-week sessions are available at COD. Classes are
    offered at flexible times that fit your schedule and at various locations
    throughout the area and online.


ENROLL IN FOUR SIMPLE STEPS

Submit Your Application
 * If you have never applied or attended College of DuPage in the past, submit
   your admission form [https://admissions.cod.edu/]. Indicate "other" as your
   educational goal for attending the College.  

Search for Classes
 * Search for Summer 2024 class availability
   [https://selfserv.cod.edu/Student/Courses].
 * In addition to classes at our main campus in Glen Ellyn, classes are also
   available at one of our COD Centers [/about/visitor-information/centers/] in
   Addison, Carol Stream, Lisle, Naperville or Westmont.
 * You can also take advantage of many of our online class offerings
   [/academics/online/index.aspx].

Clear Your Prerequisites
 * Speak to your university and/or college advisor to find out about transfer
   guidelines.
 * If you've taken the prerequisite course at another college, contact the
   Office of Student Records to review options for submitting proof. If your
   official college transcript is already on file in the Office of Student
   Records, submit the Prerequisite Verification Request Form
   [/records/forms/prerequisite-verification-request.aspx] to the Office of
   Student Records.
 * Your ACT score may meet your reading, writing, and math prerequisites. If
   your high school posts ACT scores on transcripts, have your official high
   school transcript sent to the Office of Student Records
   [/records/index.aspx].
 * If your course requires a placement test before registration, visit one of
   the COD Testing Center locations [/academics/testing/locations.aspx] as soon
   as possible to take the exams. If you are unable to test in person, you can
   test remotely via the Virtual Testing Center
   [/academics/testing/virtual-testing-center.aspx].

Register for Courses
 *  Register for courses [/registration/myaccess-student-planning.aspx] via the
   Student Portal [https://inside.cod.edu].

up to date information.
