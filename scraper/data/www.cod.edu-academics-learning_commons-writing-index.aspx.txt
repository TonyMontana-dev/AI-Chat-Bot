FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

The following frequently asked questions can help you learn more about Writing,
Reading, Speech Assistance appointments.

Who can meet with a WRSA coach?

Currently enrolled COD students or students preparing for placement tests can
make an appointment with a WRSA coach.

Do I have to make an appointment or can I walk in?

Walk-ins are welcome, but when you schedule an appointment
[https://cod.mywconline.com/], you are guaranteed that a coach will be available
to work with you.

When should I make an appointment?

You can make an appointment up to two weeks in advance. The earlier you make an
appointment, the more opportunities you will have to develop your skills.

What happens if my desired time to meet with a coach is not available?

If your desired time to meet with a coach is not available, you can sign up for
the waiting list.

If an appointment opening becomes available, you will be notified via text or
email. Once notified, login to cod.mywconline.com [https://cod.mywconline.com/]
and schedule the appointment. Appointments are scheduled on a first come, first
served basis.

How often can I meet with a coach?

You can make three reading, three writing, three ELA support and three speech
appointments per week, but no more than a total of two appointments of different
types per day. If a student does have two appointments of different types in one
day, the appointments must be scheduled with different coaches.

Students are limited to eight appointments to prepare for each ACCUPLACER or
Kaplan International Tools for English placement test.

Students connected with Access and Accommodations
[/student_life/resources/access-accommodations/index.aspx] can schedule four
sessions per week for each type of appointment, but no more than one of each
type of appointment per day.  

What happens if I can't make it to my appointment?

If you have to miss an appointment, cancel in advance; otherwise, the
appointment will be marked as missed. If you miss two appointments without
cancelling in advance, your account will be disabled for the remainder of the
semester and appointments will be allowed on walk-in basis only.

If you are running late, contact Writing, Reading, Speech Assistance at (630)
942-3355. If you are late by 10 minutes or more, your appointment will be marked
as missed and your appointment will be made available for walk-in students or
students on the waiting list.

What is the plagiarism policy?

By meeting with a WRSA coach, you acknowledge that your work is your original
thinking. If we are uncertain, we will explain what plagiarism is and provide
resources to help you understand and learn how to avoid it. The WRSA Coordinator
will be notified of this conversation.

If plagiarism is questionable after a second appointment, you agree to sit with
a coach and complete the COD Library's online plagiarism module
[https://library.cod.edu/friendly.php?s=plagiarism/tutorial] to clarify
confusion regarding citation practices and standards.

If plagiarism is suspected after a third appointment, you will lose your WRSA
privileges for the remainder of the semester and your instructor may be
notified.

I found WRSA appointments helpful because they can solve any problem I have from
brainstorming to fixing essays to speeches without any judgments. They are
friendly and nice, always willing to help as much as they can.
