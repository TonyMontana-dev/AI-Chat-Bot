The Drug-Free Schools and Campuses Regulations (345 CFR Part 86) of the
Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) require an institution of higher
education (IHE) such as College of DuPage (COD) certify implemented programs to
prevent the abuse of alcohol and use or distribution of illicit drugs both by
COD students and employees both on its premises and as a part of any of its
activities. At a minimum each institution of higher educations must annually
distribute the following in writing to all students and employees:

 * Standards of conduct that clearly prohibit the unlawful possession, use or
   distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees;
 * A description of the legal sanctions under local, state, or federal law for
   the unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol;
 * A description of any drug or alcohol counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation
   or reentry programs that are available to employees or student; and
 * A clear statement that the institution will impose sanctions on students and
   employees and a description of those sanctions, up to and including expulsion
   or termination of employment and referral for prosecution, for violations of
   the standards of conduct.

The law further requires that the institution conduct a biennial review of its
program with the following objectives:

 * Determining the effectiveness of the policy and implementing changes to the
   alcohol and other drug programs if they are needed; and
 * To ensure that the sanctions developed are enforced consistently.

The biennial review must also include determinations as to:

 * The number of drug –and alcohol-related violations and fatalities occurring
   on the campus or as part of their activities that are reported to campus
   officials;
 * The number and type of sanctions the IHE’s impose on students or employees as
   a result of such violations and fatalities.

College of DuPage acknowledges its legal obligation to conduct a biennial review
of compliance with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and authorized an
administrative review to be conducted to determine if the college is fulfilling
the requirements of the previously mentioned Federal Regulations.
