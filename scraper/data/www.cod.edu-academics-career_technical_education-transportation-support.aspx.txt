Transportation support is available on a semester basis to students enrolled in
a Career and Technical Education (CTE) Associate of Applied Science Degree or
Certificate program [/academics/programs/career_technical_programs.aspx]. Funds
are limited and are awarded on a first come first serve basis.

NOTE: The application for Spring 2024 will open in January 2024.

Students must:

 * Meet at least one of the qualifiers listed on the application
 * Be enrolled in a minimum of one in-person credit course
 * Reside a minimum of five miles from campus and/or clinical/internship/lab
   sites.

Students are provided one $50 gas card per month for the term (up to 4 months),
to be used for gas purchases only.

The gas card may only be used by the student to whom it was issued.

Students can pick up their gas card at the Cashier’s Office
[/costs/tuition/cashiers-office.aspx] between the 1st and 15th of each month,
based on office hours of operation. Students must have a valid picture ID for
pick up.

If any gas card monthly pick up is missed the student forfeits their enrollment
in this program for the remainder of the semester.

Only one gas card can be picked up per month.

Any unclaimed gas cards will be returned to the College of DuPage at the end of
the pickup period.

To remain eligible students must be actively enrolled and attending a minimum of
one in-person course. Students that drop all courses will no longer be eligible
for gas cards for the semester.

This program is funded from the Illinois Community College Board and funded 100%
through the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century
Act.
