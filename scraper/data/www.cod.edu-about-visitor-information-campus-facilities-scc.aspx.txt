Seating area in SCC [/_resources/img/slider/scc-seating.jpg]

There are several areas for students to sit and work on classwork.

 * Constructed in 1990, the 18,500 square-foot center houses computer-specific
   classrooms for the Computer and Information Science, Computer and Information
   Technology, and Office Technology Information programs.
 * A $6.5 million renovation, completed in 2013, resulted in specialized
   clusters that include high-tech classrooms, a visual and simulation lab
   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LZtRjrU0yo], networking hardware labs, a
   server/internetworking lab, software/web development labs, and end-user labs.
   This collection of resources can be shared to address the changing needs of
   all three program areas.
 * An open student work area promotes student engagement and collaboration.
