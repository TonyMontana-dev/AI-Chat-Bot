COD students can study abroad almost anywhere in the world for a full semester,
on summer programs, or on short-term, faculty-led programs. Students are
eligible for semester abroad upon completion of 12 credit hours at COD with a
minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5/4.0. Additional eligibility rules may apply by
program. Summer and short-term programs have different eligibility rules as
well.

For semester abroad, students participate through agreements that allow them to
earn COD credit and maintain financial aid through COD. Begin researching
programs here and then schedule an appointment
[kerbys@cod.edu?subject=Study%20Abroad] with Field Studies/Study Abroad.
