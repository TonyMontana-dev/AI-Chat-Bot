STUDENT PARTICIPATION

Challenge students to participate in the BHM celebration in a variety of ways:

 * Attendance:  A sheet will be available for students to sign in when they
   attend any of the BHM events, and we will send it to you upon request.  There
   is also an attendance card that will be ‘stamped’ at the end of any of the
   posted events as ‘proof’ of attendance.

 * Journaling:  Students may be asked to keep a journal and reflect on their
   participation in BHM events. Students could demonstrate growth in diversity
   awareness through a reflection of their understanding of African American
   history, culture, and life.

 * Social Justice Education (Anti-bias domains): Students participate in events
   and reflect on their growth in social justice education by utilizing the
   following anti-bias domains as a guide: Identity, Diversity, Justice, Action
   (see Notes).

 * Discussion: Incorporate topics related to the BHM theme in your classroom
   discussions including:
   * History - African American history as American history. American history
     from the perspective of African American narratives and lived experiences. 
   * Psychology – African American “Identity” and the challenge it presents to
     both African Americans as well as to other ethnic/racial groups in the
     United States (Social-Psychology of “The Looking-Glass Self”).
   * Sociology -  African Americans, social stratification, inequality, and
     social movements including the Civil Rights Movement (Freedom Rides); Using
     transportation as a new tactic to test the integrity (or lack thereof) of
     social justice and civil rights in the United States.
   * Political Science:  African-American participation in U.S. politics. How
     have African American leaders and other political leaders tried to capture
     a ‘voice’ and ‘vision’ that truly articulate the needs of African
     Americans? How successful have they been? What are the challenges?
   * Music:  The role of Music as a cultural (religious) expression for hope,
     and as a form of protest in the fight against injustice as demonstrated
     throughout African-American struggle for freedom and civil/human rights.
   * Health – Health gaps between African Americans and the rest of society.
     What are the causes for the gaps, and what strategies could markedly
     improve the health of African Americans, from birth to end of life.
   * Education – Education as a valued commodity for upward mobility among
     African Americans. What challenges remain for the education of African
     American students in DuPage County, the State of Illinois, and in the
     United States?
   * S.T.E.M.  – African Americans have a history of inventors, creators, and
     innovators. What strategies could help close the achievement gap in
     Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics? 
   * Please add your own topics based on the theme.

 


UNDERSTANDING THE ANTI-BIAS DOMAINS (SOCIAL JUSTICE EDUCATION)

Identity: Students will understand the multiple facets of their identities, know
where those traits come from, and feel comfortable being themselves in a
diversity of settings.

Diversity: Students will recognize the diversity of people in the world, be able
to identify differences and commonalities, express interest in the lived
experiences of others and develop genuine connections with others.

Justice: Students will be aware of bias and injustice, both individual and
systemic, will understand the short and long-term impact of injustice, and will
know about those who have fought for more fairness and justice in our world.

Action: Students will feel confident that they can make a difference in society
and will commit to taking action against bias and injustice even when it is not
popular or easy.

Children, 2010).
