Field and Experiential Learning, Study Abroad and Global Education supports a
diverse range of academic offerings and events at COD. 

Field Studies offers credit courses that combine classroom work with empirical
field experiences. Classes are experience based and faculty led. Courses include
Arts and Culture, Interdisciplinary Learning Communities, Outdoor Adventure, and
Science and Nature. The courses vary from local to international destinations.
Study Abroad courses immerse you in culture and language. Short term, summer and
semester-long opportunities abound. Global Education transcends borders and
expands horizons through on-campus cultural events. 

Some students enroll in courses to earn credit toward a degree or certificate;
others are interested in learning wilderness skills or visiting a particular
destination. Still others desire to explore new cultures and countries. You are
welcome to join us, whatever your interest.

their global horizons outside the confines of the classroom. Read More
