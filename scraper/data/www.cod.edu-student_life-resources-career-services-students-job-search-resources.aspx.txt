Writing Effective Impact Statements

Ask yourself: 

 1. What was the task performed?
 2. What skill(s) did you use in completing the task?
 3. Were any tools used to help you complete the task?
 4. What was the RESULT or OUTCOME of your completion of the task? How did you
    make an impact? Examples:
    1. Did you double output?
    2. Improve customer experience
    3. Reduce costs?
    4. Increase?
 5. What is the “best” action verb to use when demonstrating my abilities?
    (Produce, organize, implement…) Remember to:
    1. Articulate your capabilities so employers can have a clear understanding
       of what you can do for them.
    2. Demonstrate how your knowledge could apply to the functions of the job.
    3. State how well you can complete the tasks listed in the job description.

Resume Appearance
 * Did you proofread your resume?
   * Check for errors! Take the time to read your resume before an employer
     does. Have an extra pair of eyes look it over. Employers do not want to see
     a resume with poor spelling, grammar, and incorrect usage of words
   * Is everything typed? Do not hand write on your resume to correct errors! 
 * Does your resume look appealing? 
   * Does the information flow in a logical manner?
   * Does it look organized? o Is the space on the page utilized well?
   * Are headings used appropriately? o Are there short concise statements or
     long paragraphs? Remember to keep it short and to the point. Do not write
     long paragraphs or descriptions. 
 * Does your name stand out?
   * Your name should be larger than the section headings on the page.  Is the
     format consistent?
 * Are dates listed and formatted consistently?
   * Are locations aligned evenly?
   * Does the order of information match for each section? Employer, position
     title, location, date
 * Is all the information relevant?
   * Is the resume tailored specifically for that job position?
   * Do your IMPACT statements make sense?
   * Does your resume include keywords and action verbs to describe how your
     experience matches with the job description?
 * Do not send a generic resume.
   * Make sure your resume has information that can help the employer determine
     your ability to perform well at THEIR job.
 * Is your resume honest?
   * Make sure you can back up your resume with factual examples.
 * Is your contact information listed at the top of your resume?
   * Address: If studying away from home, list current address and permanent
     address.
   * Phone Number: list the number that you have frequent access to
   * Email Address
   * LinkedIn Profile Link

Resume Do’s and Don’ts
 * Make over your resume on a regular basis.
   * Employers do not want a “stale” resume.
   * Keep it up to date and applicable to your field.
   * This is especially important if uploading to a database. 
 * Include a Professional Summary or Summary of Qualifications
   * This section conveys what you can do for the employer.
 * Choose between an Objective statement OR a Professional Summary
   * Real-estate on a resume is valuable and taking up space by having both of
     these sections is redundant to employers.
   * If you choose to include an objective statement, make sure to convey what
     you can do for the employer and your ambitions within the field. Avoid
     “Seeking a customer service position.” –This sounds selfish to an employer.
     Employers only want to know how you can be a beneficial and productive
     employee.
 * Use bullet points and NOT paragraphs.
   * Employers take such little time to scan your resume that they want as much
     information in 30 seconds as possible.
   * If an employer has to slow down to read through paragraphs chances are,
     they will not take the time to continue reading and will pass on
     considering you for the position.
 * Customize your resume for EACH job!
   * With technology, it is easy to adjust how your skills may transfer from one
     experience to the next.
   * Take the time to read the job description and articulate how your skills
     may apply.
   * Creating impact statements that convey how your skills relate, allows the
     employer to understand how well YOU understand the responsibilities of the
     job. 
 * Do speak with faculty and current employees in the field.
   * Of course there are general resume do’s and don’ts to follow but each field
     will have unique criteria.
   * Create a resume that will standout and fit the requirements of being
     considered in your specified field.


GUIDE TO COVER LETTER WRITING

What is the function or purpose of a cover letter?

Cover letters are a vital part of the job search process. Many believe that the
cover letter is as if not more important than the resume. Although that is the
case, candidates should always submit a resume too. The cover letter introduces
the candidate to the employer. It explains to the employer WHY they should take
the time to go over a candidate’s information.

Usually, the cover letter is the initial document an employer reads from the
submitted application packet. It allows candidates to communicate how their
relevant skills would benefit the company. The cover letter invites the employer
to read the resume while the resume encourages employer to meet the candidate in
person (the interview). Since the cover letter is often the first impression, it
is essential job seekers take the appropriate time to develop and create a well
written cover letter.

When should a cover letter be submitted?
A cover letter should ALWAYS be submitted with the resume and application.
ALWAYS submit a cover letter! Most applications are electronic and will ask
interested candidates to submit a cover letter. Many applications will not
specify whether or not a cover letter is “required.” Even if the application
directions do not indicate a cover letter is required, still submit one. What if
other candidates submit cover letters and you do not? Be sure to take every
opportunity to stand out and communicate your interest to the employer!
What if I'm applying via email?
The body of the email will be the cover letter. Attach a copy of your resume to
the email and indicate this in the last paragraph of the cover letter. Again,
the cover letter should be typed in the body of the email.
What if I'm applying in person?
Job seekers applying for a job posting in person should submit a cover letter as
well. The order of the application packet should include the cover letter on
top, followed by the resume, and then the application itself underneath. Hand
the application packet to the employer in this manner.
Should a job seeker send out the same cover letter to multiple jobs?

Job seekers should NOT submit a “generalized” cover letter to employers. Just
like the resume, the cover letter should be tailored for the job which the
candidate is applying for. The cover letter and resume both provide examples of
a candidates writing ability. It is important to articulate your skills clearly
and concisely.

The cover letter should communicate what the candidate can do for the employer
as a potential employee. Along with the resume, this also offers candidates the
opportunity to convey how well they understand the job description and relate
their experience.
