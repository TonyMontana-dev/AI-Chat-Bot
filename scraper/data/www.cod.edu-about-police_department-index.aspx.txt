The College of DuPage Police Department is a professional 24-hour law
enforcement agency. Whether it is providing emergency first aid, responding to a
criminal act or providing escort service to your vehicle or class, the
department is always ready to help you.

The COD police serve to create a safe environment for learning. We do so by
partnering with our community to support administrative policies and the law. We
seek to intervene in events at a level that allows for learning when possible,
but that removes threats from the community when required.

We seek to gain voluntary compliance with policy and law by working with the
community to promote a shared vision of what an appropriate learning environment
should be, and the benefits of maintaining such an environment. We value
feedback, especially when supported by fact.

The COD police work with peers in law enforcement throughout the area, to share
information and support enforcement and service actions. This interaction
strengthens relationships required for joint work in emergency situations.


SEVERE WEATHER CLOSING

In the event that it becomes necessary to close the campus or to cancel classes
and other activities due to inclement weather, notices will be made several
times an hour on WDCB-FM (90.9), the college's public radio station.

Other stations are notified by the college and may announce cancellations:
WBBM-AM (780) and WGN-AM (720). The following television stations air closing or
cancellation notices: Channel 2 (CBS); Channel 5 (NBC); Channel 7 (ABC); Channel
9 (WGN) morning news; Channel 32 (FOX); and CLTV News. 

You can also check closing status at the Emergency Closing Center website:
www.emergencyclosingcenter.com [http://www.emergencyclosingcenter.com/]

If COD's status is not listed on the Emergency Closing Center main page, or if
the status has not been reported when doing a search specifically for College of
DuPage, then the school is open.
