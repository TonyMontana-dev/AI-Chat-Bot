SLEA


HISTORY OF SLEA

The Suburban Law Enforcement Academy (SLEA) was established by the DuPage County
Chiefs of Police Association in 1994 to satisfy the training needs of DuPage
County police departments that were at the mercy of the Chicago Police
Department Police Academy, Cook County Sheriff’s Office Academy and the Police
Training Institute at the University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois. These
facilities were taxed to the limit and were not able to meet the needs of other
surrounding Chicago land police departments. SLEA currently employs a Director,
two Program Managers (Basic Academy and Continuing Education), three
Administrative Assistants and three part-time Program Coordinators (Basic
Academy). In addition SLEA maintains a cadre of over 100 adjunct
professors/instructors, most of whom are current law enforcement personnel.
