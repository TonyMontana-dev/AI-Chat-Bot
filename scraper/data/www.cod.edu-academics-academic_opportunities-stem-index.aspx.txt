STEM - SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS

Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) emphasizes critical
thinking, data analysis and problem solving. STEM fields continue to be key
areas of job growth and development.

College of DuPage's STEM programs offer an academic foundation for careers in
STEM, as well as hands-on training to succeed in pursuing an advanced degree or
career. Learn in interactive STEM classrooms and high-quality lab spaces,
including a state-of-the-art cadaver lab. Natural environmental areas on campus
contain more than 40 acres of prairie and greenhouse facilities.

Programs cover a wide range of technical fields for every area of interest. COD
offers various programs, clubs, events and professional development
opportunities in STEM. STEM classes and special events are held frequently
throughout the year. Gain experience from others and meet other students and
faculty members who share your interest.

What is STEM?

STEM is an acronym that stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics. The STEM disciplines have been a major focus over the last decade
because of their emphasis on important skills such as problem-solving, gathering
and interpreting evidence, and making sense of information.

STEM is often referred to in the context of education and integrating
disciplines and it continues to be a key area of focus for job growth and
development. As the need for STEM professionals continues to grow, many
education institutions are working hard to promote STEM to their own students as
well as reach out to the local community.   

STEM at COD

The STEM programs at College of DuPage provide you with the academic background
and training needed to successfully pursue an advanced degree or career in
today's world. Programs cover a wide range of technical fields for every area of
interest.

The goal of STEM at COD is to enhance the quality of our STEM instructional and
outreach programs and to help current and future COD students prepare for
careers in STEM.

Our objectives are threefold:

 1. To develop a series of STEM outreach activities designed for high school
    students, current COD students, and for the larger community.
 2. To increase enrollments in STEM and Career and Technical Education fields at
    College of DuPage and maintain or increase persistence in these degrees.
 3. To raise awareness of the numerous STEM programs offered by College of
    DuPage.
