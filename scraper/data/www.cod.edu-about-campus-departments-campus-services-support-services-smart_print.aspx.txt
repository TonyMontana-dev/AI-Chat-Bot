Smart Print is a College wide initiative to centralize the management of all
printers, copiers, scanners and fax machines.

Smart Print printers and copiers are placed in various locations throughout the
College to accommodate the immediate need for small amounts of copies. All high
volume copy needs are to be forwarded to Print Services for processing where it
is most cost effective.

Please observe copyright laws when utilizing these copiers. If you have any
questions regarding copyright, reference the websites listed below:

 * https://www.codlrc.org/copyright [https://www.codlrc.org/copyright]
 * https://www.copyright.gov/title17/ [https://www.copyright.gov/title17/]

Because our logo represents us at the very highest level, it is vitally
important. All use of the College of DuPage logo, must be reviewed and approved
by the Marketing Department, extension 3370.

All prints and copies made on fleet copiers are charged back to users'
departments on a monthly basis.

Support Services provides total service support to all copy locations on and off
campus; monitoring service levels and maintaining supply inventory for all
copiers.

Please follow procedures below for service and supply requests. Contact Support
Services with any concerns in regard to our Smart Print program.

 * Regular paper (8 ½ x 11 white bond) and specialty paper (anything other than
   8 ½ x 11 white bond) must be ordered from the Smart Print Service Desk at
   extension 3500, via email (support@cod.edu [support@cod.edu]), or through the
   Support Services online request form. Only in an event when required
   specialty paper is not available, the requesting department may order it from
   an outside vendor. Cost of specialty paper will be charged back to the
   requesting department and will need budget manager's approval. Cost of
   regular paper (8-1/2 x 11 white bond) ordered for out of scope equipment will
   be charged back to the using department and will need budget manager's
   approval.
 * Paper can be ordered on the Campus Services website, under the Paper Supply
   [/about/campus-departments/campus-services/support-services/paper_supply/index.aspx]
   tab. Fill out the online form in either Chrome or Firefox (Please Do Not
   Complete the Request Using Internet Explorer). Select what type of paper is
   needed and submit, Support Services staff will then process your request and
   reach out if any additional information is needed.
 * Copier supplies can also be ordered on the Campus Services website, under
   the Smart Print Supplies
   [/about/campus-departments/campus-services/support-services/supplies/index.aspx]
   tab. Fill out the online form in either Chrome or Firefox (Please Do Not
   Complete the Request Using Internet Explorer). Select what supplies are
   needed and submit, Support Services staff will then process your request and
   reach out if any additional information is needed.

Note: At no time should you provide information regarding supplies,
copier/printer model, copier/printer serial numbers, etc. to anyone other than
Campus Services personnel.

Periodically we experience calls from "toner phoners". These are vendors that
will misrepresent themselves as our paper or supply vendor. They will sell paper
and copier supplies at highly inflated prices. Please do not order any supplies
for the Smart Print devices. Support Services handles the ordering of all
supplies for the Smart Print devices and will disperse supplies as needed. Refer
any calls and/or emails about your Smart Print device that may appear
questionable to Support Services Supervisor, Nancy Jadzak at ext. 2773.
