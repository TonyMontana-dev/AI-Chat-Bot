COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

ENGE 510 Rhetorical Theory: Classical Rhetoric (3)

Provides students with an overview of some of the histories and theories of
“classical” rhetorics beginning with their origins in Ancient Greece and Rome
and moving into more contemporary paradigms and treatments. This history will
give students a thorough grasp of how much of what is talked about today in
terms of “rhetoric” has its origin in antiquity. Students will read primary
texts by Plato and Aristotle with the goal of understanding how such thinkers
managed to lay the foundations for a field of study that is flexible, nimble,
and incredibly powerful. The rich historical and theoretical treatment of
rhetoric here will nicely prepare students to be able to follow and contribute
to current conversations within the ever-growing field of rhetorical study

ENGE 511 Rhetorical Theory II: Contemporary Rhetoric (3)
Provides students with an overview of the major theoretical foundations
necessary for the study of contemporary rhetorical theory and thinking. Much
contemporary rhetorical work begins with Nietzsche in the 19th century and runs
through a full gamut of schools and thinkers in the twentieth century related to
the heavily discussed “linguistic turn.”This course will focus quite closely on
just a few of the major theoretical contributors (Heidegger, Burke, Austin,
Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard) while also canvassing a number of different adjacent
fields of study (affect theory, apparatus theory, media studies, critical and
political theory) and various schools of philosophy (postmodernism,
structuralism/poststructuralism, deconstruction)
ENGE 512 Composition Studies I: Theory (3)
Helps students develop personally meaningful and useful ways of thinking about
teaching writing. The class is rooted in the field of Composition Studies, which
explores questions including: how do writers write? In what ways is writing
teachable? In what ways is writing learnable? How should writing instructors
approach errors in grammar or mechanics? Why should students write well? Who
decides what it means to write well? How does writing respond to different
social contexts? How does writing interact with other modes of communication,
especially now that we communicate through digital platforms? This course will
explore these questions for theoretical and practical purposes. By the end of
the course, students will have a better understanding of themselves as writers
and teachers—and will be equipped with practical tools for teaching writing.
ENGE 513 Composition Studies II: Praxis (3)
This course, which is intended primarily for prospective teachers, will help you
develop personally meaningful and useful ways of thinking about teaching
writing. The class is rooted in the field of Composition Studies, which explores
questions including: how do writers write? In what ways is writing teachable? In
what ways is writing learnable? How should writing instructors approach errors
in grammar or mechanics? Why should students write well? Who decides what it
means to write well? How does writing respond to different social contexts? How
does writing interact with other modes of communication, especially now that we
communicate through digital platforms? Our class will explore these questions
for theoretical and practical purposes. By the end of the course, you will have
a better understanding of yourself as a writer and a teacher, and you will be
equipped with practical tools for teaching writing.
ENGE 514 Multimodal Composition (3)
Provides students with an overview of the theory and practice of multimodal
composition, or composition that combines more than one mode of communication,
including writing, images, sound, space, and electronic media. Although
multimodal texts, from picture books to fliers to plays, long predate the
digital era, the advent of digital communication has proliferated these forms of
multimodal communication. In the digital era, literacy increasingly means
fluency in modes beyond writing, and multimodal composition provides a framework
for combining multiple modes in rhetorically effective ways. This course will
introduce students to foundational works that develop the theory of multimodal
composition as well as practical approaches to designing and assessing
multimodal composition projects for students.
ENGE 515 Digital Rhetoric (3)
Provides students with an overview of rhetorical theory focused on the digital
era. Given the explosion of different kinds of media, rhetoric has had to change
and transform in order to keep pace with all of the auditory, visual,
procedural, and interactive modalities on offer (modalities that range from the
latest internet meme to the most recent videogame or simple blog post and so
much more). This course will provide students with a robust theoretical
framework (while also suggesting a number of practical tools) with which to help
students think not only about all the different ways in which digital spaces
function rhetorically, but also how the tools of rhetoric can be used to view
life and learning in the digital age.
