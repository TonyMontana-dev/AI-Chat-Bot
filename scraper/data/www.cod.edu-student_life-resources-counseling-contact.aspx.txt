New Student Appointment

Call the Counseling and Advising and Transfer Services at (630) 942-2259 to
schedule a new student appointment.

Before you schedule your appointment:

 * Log in to the student portal
   [https://adfs.cod.edu/adfs/ls/?wa=wsignin1.0&wtrealm=urn%3ainside.cod.edu%3a443&wctx=https%3a%2f%2finside.cod.edu%2f_layouts%2f15%2fAuthenticate.aspx%3fSource%3d%252F]and
   click the “Steps to Enrollment” icon in the upper right corner. Review each
   of the modules. 
 * Read through the information about our Reading and Writing
   [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/reading/index.aspx]
   placement to determine if you need to take the guided-self placement test.
   This will enable a counselor to assist you in selecting appropriate courses.
   
   * Students who are non-native English speakers and have completed zero to
     four years of schooling in the United States must take the Kaplan
     International Tools for English
     [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/reading/index.aspx] test
     (ELS Placement Test) to meet course prerequisites.
   * Students enrolling in a math or science course will likely need to take a
     math placement test.
     [/academics/testing/tests-administered/placement/math/index.aspx] Math
     selection varies by major. Consult with a counselor or advisor about math
     selection.
