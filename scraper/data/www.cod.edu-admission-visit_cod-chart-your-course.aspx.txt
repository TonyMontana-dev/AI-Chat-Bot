CHART YOUR COURSE: EMBRACING DIVERSITY FOR COLLEGE SUCCESS

Starting college can feel overwhelming and confusing, especially if you are the
first in your family to attend school or if you are part of a historically
underrepresented group. The process can seem like a maze, leaving you wondering
where to begin, whether you belong, or how you'll succeed.

Our goal is to make your transition into college as smooth as possible. Our
upcoming events will break down the admissions process and equip you with tips
for navigating enrollment. We will introduce you to key departments that provide
the support and resources needed for success. More importantly, you will build
vital connections with key department representatives and experience COD's
strong sense of community firsthand.

Students are encouraged to attend both sessions to maximize their experience by
learning all about getting started and getting connected. Let us help you chart
a course to college success!
