AUDIT ENROLLMENT CHANGE REQUEST STEPS

Regularly admitted students may request a change in enrollment status to audit a
course [/registration/registration-information.aspx]by completing the below
process.

 * Register: Register for the class on your own through myACCESS
   [https://myaccess.cod.edu], Student Planning [https://myaccess.cod.edu], Chap
   App [/student_life/chap-app.aspx] or with assistance from a Registration
   staff member. 
 * Complete payment: Pay the credit course tuition in full at the time of
   registration or enroll in a payment plan
   [/costs/tuition/payment-plans/index.aspx].
 * Verify applicable timeframe: Ensure you are within the timeframe of request
   by checking the Enrollment Calendar dates
   [/registration/student-registration-calendar-2021.aspx]. (Note: This request
   is only handled for the current term, and is not accepted after midterm.)
 * Submit the Audit Enrollment Change Request: Complete the Audit Enrollment
   Change Request.
 * Request Instructor’s Permit: Send an email to the instructor requesting
   approval to audit the course. Note: Enrollment change will be updated by
   Registration staff upon receipt of the instructor’s permit and the change
   request form.
 * Update payment: Auditing a course has an additional fee
   [/costs/tuition/index.aspx]charged per credit hour. Review the charges in
   myACCESS [https://myaccess.cod.edu] and make any necessary payments.

Course Information (enter full class code)Class(es) listed above I wish to
change from credit registration to audit registration (ex: ENGLI 1101 NET01)
Confirmation*
I understand that changing my class(es) to audit enrollment and the X grade will
be applied to my transcript upon completion—no credit is earned and the audit
grade does not affect the student’s grade point average (GPA). I understand this
request can only be made once and that it is irreversible. I further understand
auditing a course may affect my Financial Aid, Academic Progress or athletic
eligibility, or program completion.
Upon submitting this change request, I will request an approval permit(s) from
my instructor(s). I understand when both permit(s) and request form are
received, the change of my class(es) to audit will be processed.
