Welcome to College of DuPage! Here are some some essential resources to review
as you begin your semester.


COLLEGE POLICIES


GRADING INFORMATION

Grading information, including the College’s forgiveness policy can be found on
the Office of Student Records [/records/final-course-grades.aspx]. However, it
may still be a good idea to ask your department or program chair about grading
norms.


ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

As members of the College of DuPage community, we share a commitment to the
highest standards of learning and ethical behavior. Learn about the College’s
academic honesty policies
[/student_life/dean-of-students/academic-integrity.aspx] and explore resources
you can use to encourage a culture of academic integrity in your classroom.


WORKING WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

How do you handle student requests for accommodations? At COD, the Center for
Access and Accommodations
[/student_life/resources/access-accommodations/index.aspx] is your partner and
resource.


SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION

College of DuPage has several policies that address different aspects of
inappropriate behavior [/student_life/dean-of-students/sexual-harassment.aspx]. 


LOGISTICS


INSIDECOD

The employee portal at inside.cod.edu [https://inside.cod.edu/] is designed to
give you single sign on access to websites, tools, and other resources that will
help you with your work, including gateways to myACCESS, Blackboard, and email;
HR benefits, campus calendars, and training documents for work tools. InsideCOD
is the primary access point for essential forms and other institutional
documents.


CLASSROOMS AND ROOM RESERVATIONS

Most classrooms are scheduled by the Central Scheduling Office. Descriptions and
schedules of these rooms can be found online.  If there’s a problem with your
scheduled room, you should work with your department administrative assistant in
charge of submitting room requests. One of the best ways to prepare for your
class is to visit the room ahead of time and test out any media devices that you
may need!


FINAL EXAM SCHEDULE

The final exam schedule is based on the official class meeting times of your
class. You can find the final exam schedule on the Academic Calendar
[https://catalog.cod.edu/academic-calendar/] page. Don’t forget, you can also
see the exam time for your class in MyACCESS.


COURSE MANAGEMENT TOOLS

COD’s centrally-provided course management system, Blackboard
[https://bb.cod.edu], allows you to send course-related announcements to your
students or distribute electronic materials to your students without having to
constantly email files. Visit the Learning Technologies Knowledge Base
[https://support.codlearningtech.org/] and find support for everything from
setting up your course to accessibility.


USING THE IMMERSIVE VISUALIZATION LAB AND AUGMENTED REALITY/VIRTUAL REALITY ROOM

Located in the Berg Instructional Center (BIC), the Immersive Visualization Lab
(IVL) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) Room allows students to view
and interact with an array of augmented and virtual reality tools.

Learn more about accessing the rooms.
[/academics/faculty/teaching-commons/teaching/using-immersive-virtual-reality.aspx]


TEACHING SUPPORT


LEARNING COMMONS

The Learning Commons [/academics/learning_commons/facts-for-faculty.aspx] is an
essential resource for faculty and students. Instructors can introduce their
classes to the Learning Commons by scheduling a tour or inviting coaches to
visit their classes. Mini-Modules provide both online and face-to-face workshops
in support of writing skills, reading, public speaking and more.


LIBRARY

The Library is dedicated to providing instruction and access to resources and
services that support teaching and learning across the College. Instructors can
turn to the Library for online teaching resources
[https://library.cod.edu/faculty], classroom equipment booking, course reserves,
research support, and professional development. Faculty members in every
discipline have a library liaison [https://library.cod.edu/faculty/liaisons]who
can provide information literacy instruction, assist in research assignment
design, and work with departments to develop collections that support teaching
and learning needs.


FACULTY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS


LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES

Learning Technologies [https://www.codlearningtech.org/] is dedicated to
researching, implementing, and supporting learning technologies in order to
create the student-centered learning environment necessary to deliver
high-quality education. Learning Technologies staff offer assistance in Online &
Hybrid Design, Blackboard Support, Web Content Management, Digital Resource
Management, and more!


FACULTY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

In support of College of DuPage’s mission to be a center for excellence in
teaching, learning and cultural experiences, the Faculty Professional
Development Program
[/academics/faculty/teaching-commons/faculty-development-program/] is dedicated
to providing programs and services that cultivate a community of inquiry around
teaching and learning; support faculty throughout their careers as educators,
scholars and professionals; and foster interdisciplinary collaboration.


ADJUNCT FACULTY SUPPORT

Committed to the institutional mission for excellence in teaching and learning,
the Office of Adjunct Faculty Support
[/academics/faculty/teaching-commons/adjunct-faculty/] provides leadership and
administrative support for adjunct faculty in partnership with the academic
divisions of the college. This is achieved through innovation and collaboration
in areas of adjunct faculty recruitment, onboarding, evaluation, and
professional development, resulting in increased student engagement, learning,
and success outcomes.


EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT CENTER

The Employee Development Center
[/about/campus-departments/employee-development-center/index.aspx] (formerly
TLC) provides training, development and resources to College of DuPage
employees. EDC is committed to providing relevant, high-quality development
opportunities that will enhance your work environment and enrich your
