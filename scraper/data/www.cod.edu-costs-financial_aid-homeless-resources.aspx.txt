RESOURCES FOR HOMELESS AND AT-RISK STUDENTS

Students in higher education are increasingly struggling to meet basic needs
such as stable housing. We provide the most up-to-date state and local resources
available to assist College of DuPage students facing homelessness or housing
insecurity.

adequate nighttime residence. This includes, but is not limited to, students
who:

 *  Are sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing, economic
   hardship, or a similar reason;
 * Are living in motels, hotels, trailer parks, or camping grounds due to lack
   of alternative accommodations;
 * Are living in emergency or transitional shelters;
 * Have a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not
   designated for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for
   human beings; or
 * Are living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard
   housing, bus or train stations, or similar settings.
