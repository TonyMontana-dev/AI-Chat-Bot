 * Policies and Procedures [/academics/divisions/health-sciences/policies.aspx]

The programs in the Nursing and Health and Sciences Division at College of
DuPage (COD) engage in continuous and systematic evaluation and improvement. We
welcome the public's comments, suggestions, ideas and constructive feedback as
part of that process; those comments are handled according to the following
procedure:

 1. This process is only for comments or concerns that cannot be addressed by
    existing grievance/due process procedures as explained in all health program
    handbooks.
 2. Comments must be provided in writing and signed by the author. Anonymous
    submission or written comments provided on behalf of an anonymous source
    will not be acknowledged.
 3. When an email is received, it is reviewed by a Nursing & Health Sciences
    Program Support Specialist. If the Program Support Specialist can respond to
    the concern, they will return an email to the email author within three
    business days. If another employee of the college is better suited to answer
    the concern/comment, the Program Support Specialist will forward on as
    appropriate and ask that the email author is responded to within three
    business days.
 4. If the comment/concern cannot be handled by the Program Support Specialist
    or his/her designee, the Dean of the Nursing and Health Sciences division
    will receive the email within 5 business days for them to respond to the
    email author.
 5. Email your Nursing and Health Sciences Division feedback to
    healthcomments@cod.edu. [healthcomments@cod.edu]
