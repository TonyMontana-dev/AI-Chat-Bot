Students affected by mental health or substance use recovery have the ability to
earn a certificate in behavioral health with the Certified Recovery Specialist
program. Watch a video to learn more about the program.

The Recovery Support Specialist certificate trains students to become Certified
Recovery Support Specialists (CRSS) or Certified Peer Recovery Specialists
(CPRS) in Illinois. The training meets certification standards for education and
practical experience hour and it prepares students to enter the professional
field of recovery support.

The certificate is supported by an Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS)
grant through June 2024 and includes classroom work and an internship. The
entire program lasts approximately one year. Through the grant, program support
is available through tuition support, books, transportation reimbursement,
computer equipment, childcare, an internship stipend and a student success
coach. 

The Recovery Support Specialist is a growing field in Illinois. Positions are
available in treatment centers, hospitals and 988 call centers. Salary ranges
from $15 to $25 an hour.

Certificate Requirements Course and Internship Requirements
Certificate Requirements 

Students seeking the Recovery Support Specialist certificate should have
personal experience with addiction or mental health recovery, confidence in
their own recovery, an interest in giving back to others and working in a
treatment environment.

Students who are pursuing their CRSS certification will need to provide
verification to the Illinois Certification Board that they are in recovery from
a mental health or substance use disorder. 

Course and Internship Requirements

The Recovery Support Specialist consists of 16 credits, 100 hours of training
and education and 300 internship hours in advocacy, mentoring, recovery support
and professional responsibility. Visit the course catalog

to see a list of required classes.

Students must also have a high school diploma or GED and complete a written exam
for CRSS.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Find answers to your frequently asked questions regarding the Recovery Support
Specialist certificate program.

What is the Certified Recovery Support Specialist (CRSS) credential?

The CRSS is a credential for people who provide professional peer services for
persons in recovery from mental illness or combined mental illness and substance
use disorders.

The CRSS professional is trained to incorporate his or her own unique personal
life experiences as a current or former consumer of services for mental health
or co-occurring mental health and substance use, in providing peer-to-peer
mental health, rehabilitation and substance abuse services.

The CRSS credentialed professional must have the knowledge and skill that meet
minimum acceptable standards of the recovery support profession, regardless of
having an academic degree. 

What is the difference between CRSS I and CRSS II?

CRSS I and CRSS II are categories of continuing education. They do not refer to
different credentials or different levels of a credential.

 * Category I CEU’s (CRSS I) include education specific to knowledge and skills
   that are directly related to the core functions outlined above, which also
   directly relate to mental health recovery and the role of peer support in the
   recovery process.
 * Category II CEU’s (CRSS II) include education related to the core functions,
   but they do not have to be specific to mental health recovery and peer
   support. 

What is the difference between the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Certificate
program and the Certified Recovery Support Specialists program?

The Psychiatric Rehabilitation Certificate Program (PRCP) is a curriculum-based
certificate program. There is no additional experience requirement beyond the
completion of the coursework.

The Certified Recovery Support Specialists (CRSS) is a competency-based
credential. In order to achieve this type of credential, a combination of
training, work experience, and satisfactory completion of an exam are required,
and the credential must be maintained over time through completion of continuing
education requirements.

Additionally, in order to obtain the CRSS, a candidate must be a person who is
or was formerly a consumer of mental health or substance use services.

For a PRCP certificate, any interested individual may complete the coursework
and obtain the certificate. 

How is CRSS defined in Rule 132?

Certified Recovery Support Specialist (CRSS) is defined as an individual who is
certified and in good standing as a Recovery Support Specialist by the Illinois
Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Professional Certification Association, Inc
(IAODAPCA).
