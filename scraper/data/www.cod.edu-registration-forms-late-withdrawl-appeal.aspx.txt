If you are still within the drop period and you are having difficulty dropping
your course, contact Student Registration Services for assistance. View your
class schedule [/registration/pdf/how-to-view-schedule-refund-dates.pdf] in
myACCESS to determine the last day to drop your course.


LATE WITHDRAWAL APPEAL GUIDELINES

Please note: Late Withdrawal Appeals will not be accepted during Final Exam Week
[/academics/final-exam-schedule.aspx]. 

If you are past the last day to drop your course and choose to file a Late
Withdrawal Appeal, read and acknowledge the following requirements:

 * I am submitting my Late Withdrawal Appeal no later than seven calendar days
   prior to my final exam date (see Final Exam Schedule
   [/academics/final-exam-schedule.aspx]).
 * I agree my reason for late withdrawal is not academic in nature. Appeals for
   late withdrawal are considered for extenuating circumstances only. (Note:
   Academic reasons will not be considered.  Academic reasons include poor
   performance, low grade or negative impact on GPA/Transcript.)
 * Within my statement, I have provided detail and backup documentation the
   extenuating circumstance that prevented me from withdrawing from my class/es
   during the designated period. (If more space is needed, I will include a
   separate statement which will be submitted along with the required supporting
   documentation to latewithdrawalappeals@cod.edu
   [latewithdrawalappeals@cod.edu?subject=].)
 * I have provided documentation supporting my appeal and acknowledge failure to
   provide adequate documentation at the time of submission will result in
   denial of the appeal. I understand that all appeal decisions are final.
 * I acknowledge a decision will be emailed to my student dupage.edu email
   within 2 weeks of the receipt of the Late Withdrawal Appeal. I am responsible
   for continuing to pursue the course in the event the appeal is not approved.
 * If I withdraw from a class by late withdrawal appeal, I understand I will not
   be eligible for refund of tuition or fees (see Exclusions below).


LATE WITHDRAWAL APPEAL EXCLUSIONS

If the appeal is due to medical reasons, submit the Late Withdrawal Appeal form
with supporting documentation and complete a Medical Appeal
[/registration/forms/medical-appeal.aspx]. For questions in regard to a Medical
Appeal, contact Registration Services
[registration@cod.edu?subject=Medical%20Appeal%20inquiry].

Appeal processes adhere to College of DuPage Administrative Procedure guidelines
and FERPA regulations
[/about/administration/consumer_legal_information/ferpa.aspx].
