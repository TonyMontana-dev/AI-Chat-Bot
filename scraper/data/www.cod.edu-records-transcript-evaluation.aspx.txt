Undergraduate credits earned at other regionally accredited colleges or
universities will be evaluated for transfer to College of DuPage upon receipt of
an official transcript. All official transcripts will be evaluated in the order
they are received. Processing time for a transcript evaluation is approximately
four to six weeks.  If you are meeting with a counselor and need your transcript
evaluated sooner, contact evaluation@cod.edu [evaluation@cod.edu].

A transcript is considered official if it is:

 * Mailed directly from the issuing institution to College of DuPage
 * Sent electronically from the issuing institution (or their designated service
   provider) to College of DuPage at evaluation@cod.edu
   [evaluation@cod.edu?subject=Transcript%20Evaluation%20Inquiry]
 * Brought to the Office of Student Records, in the original, unopened and
   sealed envelope in which it was issued.
 * Has a print date within the past 12 months.

You will be notified by email once your evaluation is complete. You can see your
transfer credits and track progress toward completion of a degree or certificate
by running your degree audit through myACCESS
[https://myaccess.cod.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor?TYPE=M&PID=CORE-WBMAIN&TOKENIDX=5585572219].


INTERNATIONAL TRANSCRIPTS

Students who earned undergraduate credits at a college or university outside of
the United States will need to have their official transcript evaluated by an
international company [/records/international-transcript-evaluation.aspx] who
specializes in evaluating coursework from other educational systems. If the
transcript is not in English, a translation will be necessary. The International
Transcript Evaluation Company Listing
[/records/international-transcript-evaluation.aspx] provides a list of
evaluation companies you may choose from to have your transcript evaluation
accepted by the College of DuPage.

College transcripts require a course-by-course evaluation. High School
transcripts need a general or basic evaluation to determine equivalency.
Students who attended college in a county with English as the official language
should contact the Office of Student Records at evaluation@cod.edu
[evaluation@cod.edu?subject=website%20inquiry] to confirm the need for an
international evaluation.


TRANSFER CREDIT

College of DuPage will accept undergraduate credits earned at other regionally
accredited colleges and universities. Grades equivalent to A, B, C, D, and S are
accepted for transfer. Transfer coursework is not computed into the student’s
cumulative GPA at College of DuPage. While there is no limit to the number of
courses or credits that may be accepted in transfer, there are limitations to
how such courses may be used to complete graduation requirements.

Transfer coursework is evaluated on a course-by-course basis and may be awarded
an equivalent College of DuPage course (i.e. ENGLI-1101), or elective credit in
a subject area (i.e. ART-9999) or a degree applicable course approved through
the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI) (i.e. DA-F2902). 

Transfer Course List
[https://tes.collegesource.com/publicview/TES_publicview01.aspx?rid=f445c9e4-48a2-44d6-877b-4dafcdfe4bfc&aid=9d77b503-ad3e-484f-8b7b-69a26686c645]
If a course does not appear here, it does not mean the course is not accepted.
New courses are reviewed and added regularly. When official transcripts are
submitted, all courses are evaluated for credit.

In the event that a student satisfactorily completes the same course at College
of DuPage as accepted in transfer, the transfer course will be marked as
repeated, regardless of the grade earned or number of credits. The grade earned,
if needed to meet prerequisite or graduation requirements, will still be
recognized.


GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS

 1. Possess a minimum 2.00 (“C”) average in both College of DuPage coursework
    and the combined grade point average of all College of DuPage courses
    numbered 1000 and above and all courses accepted in transfer from other
    institutions.
 2. Degree seeking students must complete a minimum of 20 applicable credits
    toward their degree program at College of DuPage.
 3. Certificate seeking students must complete a minimum of one-half the
    applicable credits toward their certificate at College of DuPage. In the
    case of programs requiring an odd number of credits for completion (i.e. 9),
    the majority of credits must be completed at College of DuPage.
 4. Complete all remaining general education and program-specific requirements
    as outlined in the catalog current at the time of enrollment or
    re-enrollment, including subsequent applicable changes.
