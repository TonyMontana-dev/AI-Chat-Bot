"""
This file is used to clean the documents.db database by deleting rows that contain specific strings. 
The script connects to the database, retrieves all rows from the "documents" table, and iterates through each row. 
It checks if the URL in the row contains any of the strings in the "string_list" list. 
If a match is found, the entire row is deleted from the table. 
This process helps remove unwanted or irrelevant URLs from the database.
